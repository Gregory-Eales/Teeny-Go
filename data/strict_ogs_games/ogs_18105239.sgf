C[cortexGo: Pretty good, I've updated cortex this week and it's been performing really great

C[cortexGo: I have it running with relatively low visit count so people don't die of boredom when they play agianst it, but I can crank up the number of visits if you want to do your tests
Deep Scholar: sure im testing so low visits at the moment

C[Deep Scholar: hmm surprised I won
Deep Scholar: I was worried at a few points
cortexGo: Looks like a draw, I wonder why it  resigned
Deep Scholar: yup looks like draw
cortexGo: \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: I keep breaking your stuff :P
cortexGo: XD
cortexGo: Hey at least it got a draw
cortexGo: Minus would have lost
Deep Scholar: yup currently im a little on the drawish side so working out some more fighting positions
cortexGo: I'm going to put the resign threshold lower
Deep Scholar: I noticed no scores per position
cortexGo: Yeah It doesn't work with the sai version apaprently, and I couldn't find time to fix it
Deep Scholar: ah no problem
cortexGo: Plus, people were kind of abusing it, so I'm not too enclined to fix it
Deep Scholar: makes sense
cortexGo: let me debug this position a bit
Deep Scholar: no problem
cortexGo: Alright so the pass move has lower value than all other moves, so it will refuse to pass for a long time (and in this case at some point it thought it was losing by too much -- 29% winrate -- so it resigned)
Deep Scholar: oh ok
cortexGo: I lowered the threshold so it shouldn't resign
cortexGo: There you go :)
Deep Scholar: cheers
Deep Scholar: well my dinner is soon going to be done so I'll be back in about 30 minutes or so
cortexGo: I'll probably be sleeping then, already 4am :p
Deep Scholar: goodnight hope to see you again soon
Deep Scholar: 0/
cortexGo: yep, you too!
