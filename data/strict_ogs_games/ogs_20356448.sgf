C[kata-bot: Hi, I am an experimental bot trained using an AGZ-like selfplay loop, for now just testing with a medium-sized neural net and moderate training time. Enjoy! (note: like all bots, this plays under chinese rules, and OGS's dead-stone-estimator is not perfect. Please make sure to fill the dame and/or capture all dead stones before passing, if you think there is any chance that OGS will get it wrong)
DreamingElephant: Hi, this is an automatic greeting. You're playing against a modified version of SAI with a perfect memory of every games it played on OGS. Have fun against it and go nuts!

博之カイ: Hi abcyuya-博之カイ. OGS moderator here. On this Web site, we discourage players from playing the same bot over and over again, especially if the player can win consistently. This is because it can skew both the AI rank and yours. Since your last 36 games were against DreamingElephant bot, I'm going to ask that you stop playing it so often. It's starting to look abusive, and bot abuse is grounds for a site ban. Thanks for understanding
博之カイ: sorry :D
Deep Scholar: rated games is abc problem
博之カイ: LD
博之カイ: ;D
Deep Scholar: yeah other bots have the issue so that is why it is frown upon I imagine
博之カイ: just make this bot cant accept ranked games
博之カイ: :D
Deep Scholar: see ya 0/
博之カイ: cy
