C[minusGo: Thanks for the game, I hope you had fun!
Deep Scholar: white finding d3 in the opening is nice as it is pretty cutthroat for black if it doesn't play right
minusGo: well, I think minus as black doesn't know how to deal with it so the winrates are back to 50-50
Deep Scholar: yeah i think instead of f8 maybe e8 in my book is even for white
minusGo: interesting
Deep Scholar: on goquest programs have problems with d3 as black at least the aya ones
Deep Scholar: i think i'll play a game with white to see how much it can kill me ^^
