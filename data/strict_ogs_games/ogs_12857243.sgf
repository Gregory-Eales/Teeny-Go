C[bughouse: oh wait
bughouse: woops
bughouse: mm i didn't count carefully
bughouse: i thought killing the corner would be enough for sure
bughouse: mm its winrate was already high here
bughouse: which means it already calculated the sacrifice would win?
bughouse: pretty scary
bughouse: ohh i see
bughouse: think this was my only chance
bughouse: didn't feel like i had any other options afterwards
bughouse: feels way stronger than 1d :p
bughouse: okay for sure haha
bughouse: thanks for the games!
Alderi: What was the mistake?
Alderi: (If I may ask)
Alderi: I see... Cortex has trouble with some tsumego shapes, if you can force one of its groups into a bulky five it will implode
Alderi: Yes it means it thinks it would win 81% of games against itself in this position
Alderi: But sometimes the evaluation is wrong
Alderi: because it doesn't know the right move, so it thinks a position is good when it's actually dead
Alderi: I'm glad you say so :)
Alderi: Anyway, thanks a lot for playing against it ^^ I have to go sleep, but don't hesitates to play it anytime you want :)
