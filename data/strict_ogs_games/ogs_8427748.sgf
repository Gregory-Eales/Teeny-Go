C[ovijol: You are playing very well!! Very accurate. It is clear you are 4k.
ovijol: I liked very much the opening. I have to study it further. I know the game is lost many moves ago but I usually prefer to reach the final count if they are not very unbalanced. Apologies for it ;-)
MaMiFreak: no apologies needed!
MaMiFreak: have you asked yourself the question, what will the final result be?
