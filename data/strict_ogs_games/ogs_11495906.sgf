C[minusGo: Thanks for the game, I hope you had fun!
ainu7: sorry for exploiting
minusGo: no problem
ainu7: shows awesomeness of 9x9
minusGo: it's unranked, so I let people do whatever :)
ainu7: it's still a very hard game
minusGo: besindes, mirror isn't an exploit
minusGo: it's a valid strategy
minusGo: I think minus can beat mirror if it starts on 4-4
ainu7: 9x9 mirror go involves big group semeai, which is a weakness of bots :)
minusGo: Yes
minusGo: Let me rephrase that
ainu7: hmm
ainu7: btw 4-4 mirror go is not easy to repute
minusGo: I *think* minus can beat mirror with the first move on 4-4
ainu7: let me try it
ainu7: but how to make it to start with 4-4?
minusGo: There's no way to force it to play there ^^'
minusGo: It's supposed to be its favorite opening move though
minusGo: So it playing 5-4 is more surprising to me
ainu7: well definitely move 3 breaks mirror for 4-4 opening
ainu7: yeah
minusGo: exactly
ainu7: I saw it the first time
Deep Scholar: in my book move 7 f6 provides better play to beat mirror openings
