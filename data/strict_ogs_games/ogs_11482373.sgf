C[minusGo: Thanks for the game, I hope you had fun!
minusGo: Well, minus didn't really deserve that win
ainu7: yeah move 12 was too severe
ainu7: hmm
ainu7: no, it punished very well
minusGo: Yeah but only because you decided to play something else than the wining line of play ^^'
ainu7: btw I thought one more game will be played
ainu7: haha
ainu7: ...
minusGo: Ha ^^' no the final decides the first and second places
ainu7: is the training and play done using Japanese rule?
minusGo: No, tromp taylor
minusGo: which makes it play wonky end-game in tournaments
ainu7: then, what if opponents pass like in the last game?
ainu7: yeah
ainu7: that was the question
ainu7: Fine Art once fell to that trap
ainu7: in the bot tournament
minusGo: Well it will pass too only if it wins under tromp taylor rules, but in tournaments I pass in its stead so it doesn't go crazy
ainu7: lol
ainu7: I see
minusGo: (if I let it play, it will play additionnal move to capture all that can be captured)
minusGo: and if the game is close it's basically throwing the win away because as far as it knows, playing stone inside your territory doesn't take away points (since it uses area scoring)
ainu7: yes
minusGo: Anyway, thanks a lot for the games, I gotta go back to work now :)
minusGo: Hopefully minus eventually learns about the monkey jump
ainu7: thanks!
ainu7: looking forward to see it to improve continually
minusGo: Yeah it's been improving a bit lately
minusGo: it has stopped loosing so much against SDKs
minusGo: though it still happens a bit
minusGo: Anyway, we'll see :) Have a good day! ^^
ainu7: Have a good day!
