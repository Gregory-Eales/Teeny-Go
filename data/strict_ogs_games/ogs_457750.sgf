C[dem: Hello. Have a good one!

C[joellercoaster: Hey, you too!
joellercoaster: (Had been wondering what had happened to this tournament :D)
dem: Oh yeah. I just assumed this was a ladder challenge.
dem: Do you know how many rounds this tournament is?
]
(;B[ce]
C[joellercoaster: Ha, no idea. I don't even know how it's supposed to work; I just wanted more 9x9 games.
]
(;W[gc]
C[dem: :)
dem: That works!
]
(;B[dg]
C[dem: So, wait. You've only played 9x9s up to now? (I looked at your profile - hope you don't mind my nosy-ness.)
]
(;W[cc]
C[joellercoaster: I've also recently started on 13x13,which has been interesting. But I'm starting to get impatient and might not make it to 100 :p
dem: No, I mean that's cool. I just didn't have the patience/discipline to stay on a small board!
]
(;B[fg]
C[joellercoaster: To be honest I'm not sure I do either but I'm trying. Do you mostly play 19x19 then? How is it? 
]
(;W[ed]
C[dem: Honestly, I have played several 19x19s, and I have just recently realized that I really have no clue what I'm doing.
dem: The opening moves are so important, as in a 9x9, but it's way harder to grasp what those moves should be with so much space. For me, at least!
]
(;B[gg]
(;W[ef]
C[joellercoaster: Hmm, yeah that's kind of how it looks to me too. Although maybe there is also more margin for error... punished by the opponent for mistake A, make up for it with later clever move B? 
]
(;B[ff]
C[dem: Oh sure. Especially in an even match, or against a less experienced player. I've played a couple horrible opening games recently against lower ranked players, but I was able to come back by a slightly better ability later.
dem: (Horrible for me, I meant...)
]
(;W[ge]
(;B[fe]
C[dem: On the other side, you can be an okay player, but if you make bad opening moves against a higher ranked player it will almost certainly cost you the game.
]
(;W[cf]
C[joellercoaster: That is totally true of 13x13 as well. A weak group at the beginning turns into a campaign of harassment and suddenly you're 50 points down and they're offering handicap stones for the next one :D
joellercoaster: Eep, gotta run. Back in about 12 hours!

C[joellercoaster: So I cracked and entered this: http://online-go.com/tournaments/2733/-/Under%2020K%20#02
dem: Hey, that would have been fun. Missed that one. Oh well, I'm already playing several games. Enjoy!

C[dem: This is worth checking out in my inexpert opinion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-td9ah-cM2k&feature=share&list=PLA1F22C258E9FF4BB&index=2
dem: It's a pretty thorough overview of opening theory in Go.
joellercoaster: Oh, way cool! This kind of stuff is exactly what I've been trying to find lately.

(;B[bd]
C[dem: Not entirely sure what I'm doing at this point, in case you're wondering...
]
(;W[cd]
C[joellercoaster: "Figuring out what my opponent is up to" is fairly high on the long list of stuff about Go I am trying to get the hang of.
joellercoaster: So that's, um, comforting?

C[dem: Probably for you. :)

C[dem: At the very least I just gave you a nice sente position...
joellercoaster: Well yes there was that, but it cost a few points in reduced territory... maybe a fair trade?
]
(;B[bg]
C[dem: Maybe. Your proficiency at 9x9 is certainly clear though!

C[joellercoaster: ...and now back to gote :(

(;W[hd]
C[dem: Sorry, have to go to the store. Have to pick up later. Man, it sure would be nice to be able to play a full live game once in a while!
joellercoaster: Good luck in the outside world! Likewise, I have to go and have dinner... see you in a bit!

C[joellercoaster: Moral of the story: wine and tournament rounds do not mix.
dem: Hmm. On the other hand, your're real life activities sound more fun than mine at the moment.
dem: Oops. * Your... 
joellercoaster: Ha :P
]
(;W[ib]
C[joellercoaster: I think that's that... well played.
dem: Meh. It was a lucky break. I would prefer to win by better strategy, which you in fact demonstrated instead. 9x9s are tough. One slip up is all it takes.
]
(;B[hd]
C[joellercoaster: That is indeed all.
joellercoaster: Ahh well, lesson learned - and you were sharp enough to see it, so I can't feel too bad.
joellercoaster: You still had to play yourself into a position where one good capture would turn it around!
dem: I've done it so much myself! Those stairstep shapes on the side can be nasty.
]
(;W[df]
C[joellercoaster: I had been in the habit of using them as sacrifice bait :(
joellercoaster: (not always successfully :P)
dem: Interesting. Have to remember that.
dem: I'm learning to try to use them to gain sente.

C[joellercoaster: Well, thank you for the game - and good luck in the rest of the tournament, I think you'll do well.
dem: :)
dem: Thank you as well. I enjoyed our conversation also! Hope you get something from the video(s), and good luck with the 19x19s!
joellercoaster: Thank you - I am very sure we will play again.
