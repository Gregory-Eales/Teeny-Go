C[MVGO: you have to count throughout the game
MVGO: be aggressive only when you need to be
pinpoint: I have a hard time counting in the middle 
MVGO: last time I was just always aggressive, see where that got me
pinpoint: :)
pinpoint: I was desperate in this game too
MVGO: counting gets better over time
pinpoint: in bad shape early
pinpoint: is there a trick to counting?
MVGO: yes, I did not need to push much to get my points
pinpoint: an easier way than just brute force?
MVGO: I just got it over time
MVGO: there's probably a much better way
MVGO: that's probably why i'm only 2 kyu
pinpoint: I usually just figure if I play white and I make two groups live, it'll be enough
MVGO: :P
pinpoint: you seem stronger than 2k
pinpoint: I played some 2k-3k. They are not nearly as strong
MVGO: each kyu looks like much in 9 by 9
MVGO: again?
pinpoint: I even played some 1d & 2d. I have a harder time against you
pinpoint: ok
