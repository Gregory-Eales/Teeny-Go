C[kata-bot: Hi, I am an experimental bot trained using an AGZ-like selfplay loop, for now just testing with a medium-sized neural net and moderate training time. Enjoy! (note: like all bots, this plays under chinese rules, and OGS's dead-stone-estimator is not perfect. Please make sure to fill the dame and/or capture all dead stones before passing, if you think there is any chance that OGS will get it wrong)
DreamingElephant: Hi, this is an automatic greeting. You're playing against a modified version of SAI with a perfect memory of every games it played on OGS. Have fun against it and go nuts!
