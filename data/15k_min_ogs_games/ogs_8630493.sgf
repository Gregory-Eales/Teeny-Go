C[aufwieder: thanks
3.141: you could have stopped it right
3.141: somewhere around when b5 and c5 happened?
aufwieder: i think my move 28 was a mistake
aufwieder: maybe instead A5 or C4
3.141: ah
3.141: a5 I like
3.141: can't ignore
3.141: must connect
3.141: oh
3.141: but
3.141: must be c4 no?
3.141: a5 I connect no escape yes?
aufwieder: i was thinking B7 if black connects
3.141: oh oh
3.141: the connection is a turn right
3.141: the first connect
3.141: I see
3.141: yes that would have done it
3.141: never win
3.141: first connection declares my intent
3.141: thank you
aufwieder: ok gg!
3.141: oh you too ofc
