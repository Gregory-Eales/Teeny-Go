C[nate123: thanks for the game
ilop: Thanks for the game 
nate123: my main problem is that im scared to go into 19x19 games
nate123: the big board intimidates me for some reason
nate123: thanks
grizato: oh, ok
grizato: would you like an unranked practice for 19x19
grizato: I used to be indimidated, but now I prefer it
grizato: I find it less harsh...
grizato: more forgiving maybe
grizato: nevertheless, your 9x9 play is impressive
