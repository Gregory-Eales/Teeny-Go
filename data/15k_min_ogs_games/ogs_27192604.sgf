C[doge_bot_4: Thanks for playing. If you want a weaker/stronger bot match with you, recommend try to play with 'ELOtest'. It can calculate & match your rank after few games.
doge_bot_4: You resigned too early, marked as cheating behavior. If this is an incorrect result, or you have any question, please contact my administrator
