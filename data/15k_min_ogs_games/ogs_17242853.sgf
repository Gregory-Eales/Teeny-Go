antsanchez: If you permit me a tip, I think you are too focused on trying to kill me instead of doing your own straregy
antsanchez: but I am not an expert
antsanchez: so, it is just my opinion
antsanchez: gg
greenplayingblack: no thats good advice
greenplayingblack: I was trying to force you into a group by killing me
antsanchez: I think if you are trying to kill someone, you are always one steep behing. If he doesn't do any errors, you will lose
antsanchez: you want to play again?
greenplayingblack: yes
antsanchez: It says I am not allowed to challenge you
antsanchez: so may be you have to send this challenge
