seelolz: yo guys sorry if i disturb you right now, but I have a question... I started just yesterdays to play go and I still have the feeling i can't grasp the game at all... I started reading about tactics and the main purpose of the game but still I don't get the feeling i get the main hang of it... do you have any idea?
