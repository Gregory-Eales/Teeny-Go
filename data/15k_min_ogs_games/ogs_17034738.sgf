antsanchez: you could have made 2 eye there
antsanchez: and may be you could have won
dkode: how could i have played that out differently
dkode: around 30-35
dkode: im assuming instead of F9 i should have protected cut at B8
dkode: at move 29
antsanchez: yes, may be
dkode: \[object Object\]
antsanchez: but anyway, I see you have just played 76 games or so, this is nothing :) I started being better at about 250 or so
