C[SekiThisIs: i dont think mirror go is a bad strategy for the first few white moves
SekiThisIs: at least if black doesnt play tengen 
grenouillette: tengen?
SekiThisIs: its just that i suck at blitz and couldnt make the corners live 
SekiThisIs: the center stone 
grenouillette: ah
grenouillette: then don't play blitz?
SekiThisIs: well 
grenouillette: it's really boring to play with someone who plays mirror
SekiThisIs: how should i learn without playing 
grenouillette: then play
SekiThisIs: lots of people say that 
grenouillette: don't play mirror
SekiThisIs: but i dont think its true 
grenouillette: best way to not think
SekiThisIs: when you play mirror, its really interesting to find the best moment to break symmetry 
SekiThisIs: you did, for example 
grenouillette: i just do it ASAP when someone does that
grenouillette: it's just boring as hell otherwise
SekiThisIs: your move 7 was worth more than komi 
SekiThisIs: well not necessarily 
SekiThisIs: your opening was very centric, there it worked 
SekiThisIs: therefore instead of mirroring, probably something like G7 would be better on move 6
grenouillette: black has to play in the center on 9x9 
grenouillette: with a 5.5 komi
grenouillette: otherwise white can just get 40% of the board and win with that
SekiThisIs: i dont know man, depends on the situation 
SekiThisIs: i usually open with tengen as black 
grenouillette: been playing F4-F6 a lot with black
grenouillette: pretty hard to counter
SekiThisIs: you can forfeit the center as black, if it means you get 3 corners 
SekiThisIs: hmm yeah i dont like those opening moves on F4-F6 at all 
SekiThisIs: i suck at playing them, but also on defending against them 
SekiThisIs: maybe i should study these more
