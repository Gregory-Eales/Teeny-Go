C[thomasijontichy: ok so lately I have mostly played this
mark5000: Looks good
thomasijontichy: lol
mark5000: That's fine. All 5 central moves should be ideal, although it's only a hunch.
mark5000: I have a variety of responses here.
thomasijontichy: for some reason I have had problem with tengen lately

C[mark5000: I'll try this one today
mark5000: It's normal to favor some openings over others. You can play what you like, or you can play what you don't like to build experience. The two moves should be equal.
thomasijontichy: I just feel like tengen isnt enough. dunno if I make myself clear but
thomasijontichy: ok

C[thomasijontichy: I resign, no way to make that one work
thomasijontichy: that I can see anyway
mark5000: I agree.
thomasijontichy: one more?
mark5000: Sure.
mark5000: In case it wasn't clear, E6 was inaccurate.
thomasijontichy: yup
mark5000: It left you with an empty triangle and wasn't effective enough resistance in the fight.
