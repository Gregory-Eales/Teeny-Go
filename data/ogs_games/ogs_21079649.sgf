C[dexy: for the record: no moderator showed up, and the time ran out
Mrrr: Hello
Mrrr: I have not seen your chat
Mrrr: You could talk privately, then i would have seen it. My strenght is as it is. 
Mrrr: I don't cheat and i am sad you think so. 
dexy: I am said to see that 5d is not willing to go through gmae, So i will use my experience and point to moves played in low time and being of high strength.
dexy: Most importantly G2 in the game. I cannot find a way to post a link to the move in game. I can see AI is not doing well in categorasing the strength of moves in a sense what would play a player being low kyu, high, kyu, low dan, high dan, etc.
mark5000: Reviewing this game just to verify if any funny business happened.
mark5000: Looks more or less normal.  But surprising result for 2k against 3d.
