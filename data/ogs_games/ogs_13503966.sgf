C[Sawcutgorge: Thx for the game
nwurd: thanks, I feel pretty lucky on this one... I would lie if i say "i perfectly knew how it would end"... and I don't think I did right in the beggining. If you have any advice on the first moves where black should have played differently, I'd like to hear from you !
