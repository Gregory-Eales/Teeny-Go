Tehnoart filosof: What is the situation with Aborigines. I have great respect for that people!
]
(;W[cc]
C[BrendanBeaton: I do too
BrendanBeaton: The situation is sad
BrendanBeaton: They are like 2% of our population but make up a really high number of our encarcerated. 
BrendanBeaton: They have lower health and education outcomes
BrendanBeaton: Australia is fairly racist towards them
]
(;B[cb]
C[Tehnoart filosof: They are growing sick because they live in a territory where Great Britain made atomic explosions and uranium mining
]
(;W[de]
C[BrendanBeaton: So they make 3.3% of our population but are 28% of our gaol population
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, I haven't looked at the land that they are testing on. I would hope it isn't populated

C[BrendanBeaton: Very very sad
Tehnoart filosof: This Wongar fellow was my compatriot that was lost in the desert. And Aborigines found him
Tehnoart filosof: He lived with them

BrendanBeaton: Oh true
]
(;W[]
(;B[]
C[BrendanBeaton: gg <3 
Tehnoart filosof: But then Aborigines started to die
BrendanBeaton: Oh
BrendanBeaton: From diseases from him?
Tehnoart filosof: Because Birtish goverment made atomic probes in their desert
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay
Tehnoart filosof: So he write to Jean Paul Sartre to discover this
BrendanBeaton: I haven't looked at the extent to which they bombed or how inhabited it is now
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay
BrendanBeaton: Wow, googling Jean Paul Sartre. What a list of titles
Tehnoart filosof: Find some of his books. Australian goverment arrested him
BrendanBeaton: Arrested Wongar?
Tehnoart filosof: And took his books
BrendanBeaton: :(
Tehnoart filosof: His wife and children died form disease
BrendanBeaton: :'(
BrendanBeaton: Brings a lot of shame to me
Tehnoart filosof: Why?
BrendanBeaton: I'm sad to say that most Australians don't care
BrendanBeaton: Just how we treated them and continue to treat them
Tehnoart filosof: Because they live their lifes
Tehnoart filosof: They are not guilty
BrendanBeaton: Yep :(
Tehnoart filosof: Goverment is guilty
BrendanBeaton: Yeah :(
BrendanBeaton: For land
BrendanBeaton: For money
Tehnoart filosof: It is interesting how all this European crimes are morally justified
BrendanBeaton: By the Europeans yeah. I think it is morally unjustifiable 
BrendanBeaton: And most non whites would agree
BrendanBeaton: I am white
Tehnoart filosof: We Serbs have one sentence
BrendanBeaton: Yeah?
Tehnoart filosof: Make good it will bring You good
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, I like and agree with that sentiment
Tehnoart filosof: Make wrong, Hope! 
Tehnoart filosof: Hope You wont be punished
BrendanBeaton: It's weird because Australia has always thought of itself as this friendly, treat people with respect, look after people 
Tehnoart filosof: But at the end all bad deeds are punished
BrendanBeaton: I don't think I agree with that last statement 
Tehnoart filosof: I think most Australians are like that
Tehnoart filosof: Im quite sure in it
BrendanBeaton: I would like to think that all bad deeds are punished but there are too many healthy billionaires in the world
BrendanBeaton: Sure in it from a religious view point?
Tehnoart filosof: Religion is most important!
BrendanBeaton: What religion is Serbia mostly?
BrendanBeaton: Australia is a lot athiest
Tehnoart filosof: Orthodoh Christian
Tehnoart filosof: Orthodox
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay
BrendanBeaton: Wow, Australia is 52 percent Christian
BrendanBeaton: 30% no religion
Tehnoart filosof: But Protestants have different ethics
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, I don't know a lot about them but they are basically one of the started of capitilism?
BrendanBeaton: Or neoliberalism?
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, Capatlism
BrendanBeaton: I'm non religious but don't mind peoples religion so long as they aren't causing harm
BrendanBeaton: We only in the last couple years allowed same sex marriage
BrendanBeaton: same gender marriage
Tehnoart filosof: Religion is most important for making comunity
BrendanBeaton: Hmmm I disagree
BrendanBeaton: But
Tehnoart filosof: Same sex genders will I hope never be allowed in Serbia
BrendanBeaton: I do agree that it does a lot for creating community for people
BrendanBeaton: Aaah, I'm sorry to hear that
BrendanBeaton: I don't think you need religion for community
Tehnoart filosof: Because it against ethical propositions of comunity
BrendanBeaton: but I do agree that community is important
BrendanBeaton: Maybe against your community, but I would question the values that your community has
Tehnoart filosof: And if you break that propositions you disolve comunity as such
BrendanBeaton: It is not against my community
Tehnoart filosof: But you comunity agreed with that, and my will not
BrendanBeaton: At the moment
Tehnoart filosof: We are not in the same comunities
BrendanBeaton: This is true
Tehnoart filosof: Im quite sure it will not anytime
BrendanBeaton: I'm sorry to hear it
BrendanBeaton: What do you feel about these people?
BrendanBeaton: They are still human?
BrendanBeaton: They still love, they still have mothers, they still worship your god but in secret
Tehnoart filosof: Nothing. They exist without problems in Serbia. It is their personal thing
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, likewise with Australia before recent
Tehnoart filosof: But it is not the thing of the comunity
Tehnoart filosof: And one of the values of mine comunity
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, I get that. Moral relativism 
BrendanBeaton: Is a tricky thing
Tehnoart filosof: It is quite normal in protestant culture
BrendanBeaton: I guess I would hope for a place where you are free to worship your god, where others are allowed to worship their gods and people are free to exist as they are without causing harm and in peace
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, it would be
BrendanBeaton: It makes me sad, but it would be
Tehnoart filosof: But prostestant culture is most destructive of all
BrendanBeaton: Sure, I do not know a lot about it
BrendanBeaton: I do know that I do not enjoy the divisiveness of religion though
Tehnoart filosof: Because it relyies on individualism and liberalism
BrendanBeaton: Protestant culture?
Tehnoart filosof: Yes
BrendanBeaton: Yeah that makes sense with relation to capitalism
Tehnoart filosof: So it have to expand
Tehnoart filosof: And expanding new is destroying everything that opposes
BrendanBeaton: I personally like individualism and liberalism but I do not like the removal from community that seems to come wit it
BrendanBeaton: with it*
BrendanBeaton: I think that autonomy and liberalism but with community ties is the ideal
Tehnoart filosof: I think that Protestant values of free and constant change, weak comunion and strong God-like personality are in problem now
BrendanBeaton: Yeah I agree. I think that everyone is in trouble now though
Tehnoart filosof: It looks that Chinese model of strong community is much stronger now
BrendanBeaton: It does seem so, it comes with its own problems though
Tehnoart filosof: Im not quite sure
Tehnoart filosof: They look mostly succesful
BrendanBeaton: I don't think either is the optimal, I think somewhere in the middle
BrendanBeaton: I guess it depends on how you measure success
Tehnoart filosof: When this corona started only country that was able to help Serbia was China 
Tehnoart filosof: And Russia
Tehnoart filosof: Europe was totally incompetent
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, China is a manufacturing juggernaut 
BrendanBeaton: and politically I would think that it serves Russian interest to help Serbia
Tehnoart filosof: But their values are based on strong community
Tehnoart filosof: Bah. We had more problems from their help
BrendanBeaton: Strong community enforced to serve state
BrendanBeaton: From Russia?
BrendanBeaton: I don't think that state enforced culture for the people to serve the state is noble
Tehnoart filosof: In history. Because Everyone attack Serbia as Russian ally
BrendanBeaton: Aaaah sure
BrendanBeaton: It was Serbia at war with ummmmm
Tehnoart filosof: Turks, Germans, Austro/Hungary, Third reich, NATo
Tehnoart filosof: Want more?
BrendanBeaton: Austro hungary is the people I was thinking of
BrendanBeaton: It was Serbia who assassinated ummm
Tehnoart filosof: It was Empire that dissolves after WWI
BrendanBeaton: Franz ferdinant
BrendanBeaton: ferdinand
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, very much so
Tehnoart filosof: Yes!
Tehnoart filosof: But not Serbia but some people in Bosnia
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, then war between Austria / hungary and Russians backed serbs and bosnians and Germany backed Austria
BrendanBeaton: Then ww1
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay Bosnian serb nationalist they call him
BrendanBeaton: Was in the Bosnian capital. Right
Tehnoart filosof: Bosnia was occupied by Austro HUngary from Turkey. In Bosnia lived Serbs, muslims and catholics.
BrendanBeaton: Was taken over from Turkey? What year was that?
Tehnoart filosof: And that organisation has all of them Serbs, muslims and catholics. It was against Austro HUngary occupation of Bosnia
BrendanBeaton: I didn't know the ottomans owned Bosnia
BrendanBeaton: Yeah
BrendanBeaton: I recall
Tehnoart filosof: Of course. For centuries
Tehnoart filosof: The made muslims
BrendanBeaton: But Franz ferdinand was pro bosnian seperatist ?
Tehnoart filosof: in Bosnia
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay, interesting
Tehnoart filosof: No :)
BrendanBeaton: Oh really? I thought he was sympathetic to the Bosnian people
BrendanBeaton: One of the only ones though
Tehnoart filosof: It was Austro HUngary archduke that has to succseed Emperor
BrendanBeaton: Yeah
Tehnoart filosof: Bosinan people are Serbs, muslims and catholics. 
BrendanBeaton: Sure
BrendanBeaton: I thought Serbs was a nationality
BrendanBeaton: Why are you seperating them from religions?
BrendanBeaton: Are not some Serbs muslim?
Tehnoart filosof: Bosnian Serbs were majority of Bosnian population in these times, and they wanted to join kingdom of Serbia 
BrendanBeaton: Aah right
Tehnoart filosof: Serbs live not only in Serbia, but also present Croatia, Montenegrio, Bosnia, Macedonia, Romania etc.
Tehnoart filosof: Bosnia was a territory not a nationality
BrendanBeaton: Interesting, I have territory and nationality so tied together in my language
Tehnoart filosof: But in a present time Bosnian muslims declare themsleves as "Bosniaks"
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay
Tehnoart filosof: In these times they declare mostly as a Serbs
BrendanBeaton: Europe borders were in such flux
BrendanBeaton: Sure
BrendanBeaton: Why the distinction now? Bosniaks?
Tehnoart filosof: Because they generated from orthodox Serbs that become muslims
Tehnoart filosof: And now have to make difference
BrendanBeaton: so needed a new name? You can't be muslim and a serb?
BrendanBeaton: Such an interesting part of the world
Tehnoart filosof: They were muslim serbs for centuries
Tehnoart filosof: But then, they are trying to make their own nation
BrendanBeaton: Aaaah sure
Tehnoart filosof: Because they live mostly in Bosnia 
BrendanBeaton: Yeah okay
Tehnoart filosof: The call themselves Bosniaks
Tehnoart filosof: But some Bosniaks live in Serbia too
BrendanBeaton: Sure
Tehnoart filosof: Complicated ;)
Tehnoart filosof: Sorry for bothering You
Tehnoart filosof: ;)
BrendanBeaton: You are not bothering me at all!
BrendanBeaton: So interesting!
BrendanBeaton: I love history, world history, european history
BrendanBeaton: War historyu
Tehnoart filosof: I like history too
BrendanBeaton: I study Science but love history as an interest
Tehnoart filosof: One of a way to control people is ignorance 
BrendanBeaton: Yep, I agree
BrendanBeaton: ignorance and fear
BrendanBeaton: Us and them
Tehnoart filosof: Ignorance and satisfaction
BrendanBeaton: and satisfaction you say?
Tehnoart filosof: To make people to be like children
BrendanBeaton: Sure
BrendanBeaton: Docile
Tehnoart filosof: Bad children
BrendanBeaton: haha xD
Tehnoart filosof: Stupid and greedy for chocolate
BrendanBeaton: Yeah, not the polite child
Tehnoart filosof: Lower classes of protestant societies are like that mostly
BrendanBeaton: I would like to think I am a polite child :)
Tehnoart filosof: Of course You are! :)
BrendanBeaton: haha xD
BrendanBeaton: Romania, I didn't know there was a country called Romania
Tehnoart filosof: In Serbia we have no social clases
BrendanBeaton: Really?
Tehnoart filosof: No
BrendanBeaton: Not even unspoken class?
BrendanBeaton: You don't have wealth disparity?
Tehnoart filosof: We have rich and poor people but they do not make classes
Tehnoart filosof: Because we do not value people by wealth
BrendanBeaton: Hmmmm
Tehnoart filosof: But mostly are they good people or not
BrendanBeaton: I mean, neither do I but I would think that wealth is a form of class
Tehnoart filosof: If wealth is value by itself
Tehnoart filosof: But in some societies is not
BrendanBeaton: The people who are benefitting from the poor being poor are in a class onto themselves
BrendanBeaton: I would argue
Tehnoart filosof: Look at the Aborigines
BrendanBeaton: I do not mean to give them class, I do not think they deserve it but I think that the wealthy are a leach upon society
Tehnoart filosof: Or Chinese
BrendanBeaton: and set themselves apart
BrendanBeaton: What do you mean by aborigines?
Tehnoart filosof: They do not have wealthy people
Tehnoart filosof: Their society has no classes
BrendanBeaton: China definitely does
BrendanBeaton: and aborigines society didn't really survive as it was into our current time. They did not have capitalism 
Tehnoart filosof: China is longstanding first economic power of the world. 
BrendanBeaton: and have huge wealth inequality
Tehnoart filosof: They have that disturb in 18 and 19 century
BrendanBeaton: hence why they can produce so much of the worlds goods
BrendanBeaton: I think that capitalism generates classes
Tehnoart filosof: But they look on it like a community problem
Tehnoart filosof: Chinese do not look on itself in individualistic way
Tehnoart filosof: But like part of greater society
Tehnoart filosof: And success of society is success of thereown
Tehnoart filosof: So making China great again is political aim of all Chinese people for a long period
BrendanBeaton: I mean, I think I do agree with that being spoken as their sentiment
BrendanBeaton: and I think it is the sentiment of the lower classes and middle classes
Tehnoart filosof: And they succeeded
BrendanBeaton: but if the billionaires there really though that, they wouldn't be billionares
BrendanBeaton: thought*
Tehnoart filosof: In China Communist party can arrest any billionaire 
BrendanBeaton: In capitalism, someone needs to be poor or it doesn't work
BrendanBeaton: I mean, maybe they can
BrendanBeaton: But do they?
BrendanBeaton: I just googled and they have a lot of billionaires
Tehnoart filosof: Of course they do
Tehnoart filosof: Because these billionaires work for the state
BrendanBeaton: maybe if they don't pay their cuts to the communist party
BrendanBeaton: They work for the state?
Tehnoart filosof: They make extremely efficient mechanism of Chinese values
BrendanBeaton: They own private enterprises
Tehnoart filosof: But they are controled with the aims of political elite
Tehnoart filosof: Like in a Huawei case
BrendanBeaton: and political elite are greedy
BrendanBeaton: Huawei case?
Tehnoart filosof: Huawei is private company
BrendanBeaton: Aah
BrendanBeaton: What about them?
Tehnoart filosof: But it is hand of the communist party for the western politicians
Tehnoart filosof: Because they made technologically better 5G connection
BrendanBeaton: Sure, yeah the communist party does own a lot of capital
BrendanBeaton: I just think it is immoral to have billionaires
Tehnoart filosof: Lets continue later! Im sorry I have to go now!
BrendanBeaton: I have to as well :)
Tehnoart filosof: Lets make friends
BrendanBeaton: My name is Brendan. I sent you a request already
Tehnoart filosof: And play again
BrendanBeaton: It was lovely talking
BrendanBeaton: Yes, lets :)
Tehnoart filosof: Im Alexander
