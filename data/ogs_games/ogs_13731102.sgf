C[hajoucha: well, thats it. Thank you. 
Elmindreda_Go: Gg
Elmindreda_Go: i think you would have won if you didnt invite the ko
Elmindreda_Go: Would have been close
Elmindreda_Go: \[object Object\]
Elmindreda_Go: Hmm.. Says imup by 1.5
Elmindreda_Go: \[object Object\]
Elmindreda_Go: White wins by .5
Elmindreda_Go: \[object Object\]
Elmindreda_Go: Var 3 w also wins by .5
Elmindreda_Go: \[object Object\]
Elmindreda_Go: But black could still win like this..
Elmindreda_Go: Very close
hajoucha: well, I think even with the ko black would win. 
hajoucha: close, but still win. That is why I tried something else. 
hajoucha: I think the move 14 (D8) was a mistake. I should have taken different route... ponuki basically.
hajoucha: anyway, nice game.
