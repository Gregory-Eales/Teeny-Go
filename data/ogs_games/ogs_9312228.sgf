C[froofy: Yes, and so you should beat me.

C[dustygoban: Now comes the very traditional part of the OGS game.
froofy: kos are nice, don't you think?

C[dustygoban: We will watch the 30 kyu desperately try to make his opponent mess up.

C[froofy: Unless every other point is filled, there's still a chance!

C[dustygoban: Okay, now is the other traditional OGS ritual.
dustygoban: Here, the 30 kyu leaves the game without resigning, just to spite his 35 kyu opponent.

(;W[ef]
C[froofy: Almost my favorite.
dustygoban: But not after filling in dame in a game that's already lost!
dustygoban: or rather, not before
dustygoban: You have to think very hard about what dame to fill in.
froofy: Yes, I'm having trouble.
froofy: Maybe a teaching game is in order?
dustygoban: One sec, I will put it through a strong go computer engine.
dustygoban: *whirring*
dustygoban: The optimal move is E6.

(;B[ed]
C[dustygoban: Wait... no... the optimal move is to fill in the dame at H2.
froofy: Thank you!
froofy: Oh, drat!
froofy: No I lose?
dustygoban: Okay, we're approaching the end of the game.
dustygoban: There is one last thing for the 30 kyu to do.
dustygoban: He must invade a 5 point territory.
froofy: How about disputing the dead groups?
]
(;W[ih]
C[dustygoban: OK, the invasion has started.
dustygoban: Do you know the proper killing sequence?
dustygoban: If you do, you are at least 5 dan.
froofy: Yes.  I am incredibly strong.
froofy: Wait.
froofy: Uh, oh.
froofy: I guess I don't.
dustygoban: Pass, and I will show you.
froofy: So maybe I'll pass so you can show me.

C[dustygoban: You have to play at H2, H1, J1, and J3.
froofy: How about that?
dustygoban: No, stupid.
dustygoban: My top-left group is alive.
froofy: All white groups are dead.
dustygoban: Don't you see the eyes at B9 and A8?
froofy: I get everything.
froofy: There!
froofy: Hey, I fixed it!
dustygoban: Dude, I can't accept a wrong score.
froofy: I must insist.
dustygoban: I'm 30 kyu, but I'm not an idiot.
dustygoban: Or an American or something.
froofy: Otherwise I will commit hara-kiri and it will be on you!
dustygoban: How about this?
froofy: Much better.
dustygoban: This looks fair.
froofy: Accept now.
dustygoban: The lion gets his share.
froofy: You must accept your win.
froofy: It is honor.
dustygoban: Fine, but only if we rematch and I beat you properly.
froofy: Hahaha!
froofy: Sure.
