C[kw23: ok
kw23: that's all i could manage i guess 
kw23: thanks again
The Almighty God: I think so too. The lower group was already alive with B2 and C"
kw23: i wasn't too sure about that
kw23: if you move to f1 then s2
kw23: d2
kw23: the thing will be complicated
kw23: right?
The Almighty God: if i played F12 you defend i cute at A3 and you have a living group with E1
The Almighty God: *F1
The Almighty God: \[object Object\]
The Almighty God: Other wise you could have just played A3 and it was alive
kw23: \[object Object\]
kw23: i thought about something like that
The Almighty God: \[object Object\]
kw23: but not many eyes left
kw23: mostly destroyed
The Almighty God: \[object Object\]
The Almighty God: lives
kw23: that was what i didn't see indeed
kw23: yes
kw23: but still
kw23: after your g8
kw23: not much is left
kw23: d9
kw23: that's about it
The Almighty God: D9 works?
kw23: yes, in a small way
The Almighty God: Sorry, read D8
The Almighty God: Interesting one. Very complicated game
kw23: yes
kw23: i tried something new to me, c6
kw23: didn't work
kw23: d8, then move to upper right corner would be more practical
