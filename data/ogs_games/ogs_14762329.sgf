C[LionOfJuda: gg
TherealJC: oops
LionOfJuda: otherwise ;)
TherealJC: sry didnt hear the timer
LionOfJuda: pity - was an interesting game
TherealJC: didnt even have the headphones plugged in tbh
LionOfJuda: Oh well :)
LionOfJuda: another time to the end :)
TherealJC: yeah it was 
TherealJC: would have liked to figure out how to make it out alive
LionOfJuda: I'm not sure either who would have won that
TherealJC: \[object Object\]
LionOfJuda: looks like it - so it would have been your win then
TherealJC: i would've played b8, idk how you would've responded though
TherealJC: but i think this is the most likely outcome
LionOfJuda: definitely - I wouldn't have really any other options
