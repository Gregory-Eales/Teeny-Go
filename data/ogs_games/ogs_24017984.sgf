C[katrain-weighted: W H8 caused a significant score change (B gained 1.7 points) -> Win Rate W 99.9% Score W+12.9 AI Thoughts: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are A8 (60.19%), J6 (19.17%), G5 (13.01%), F1 (1.28%), H1 (1.18%). Playing policy-weighted random move H8 (0.5%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=0.10%, num moves > lb=17).
