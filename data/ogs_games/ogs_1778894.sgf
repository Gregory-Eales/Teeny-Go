C[gogogo12: i like 9x9 games
]
(;W[]
C[Nakka101: i feel better about 19x19 games haha
Nakka101: i'm not sure if i'm better at them
gogogo12: 19x19 takes too long
Nakka101: so, want to show me how i could have avoided some of this?
gogogo12: i just like quick games
Nakka101: if you have time :)
gogogo12: well you have to connect your stones and separate your opponents stones
gogogo12: in 9x9 is hard to play good, bc you get into fights in early moves
Nakka101: yeah
gogogo12: 19x19 you have more room to play
Nakka101: i do alright at territorial framework but fighting is tough for me
gogogo12: yeah
gogogo12: make sure you have at least 2 eyes to survive
Nakka101: i was just reading an article that suggests i need to do a lot more tsumego
Nakka101: i play and read and i feel i have strong fundamentals but everyone kicks my butt at fighting
gogogo12: lol
gogogo12: watch the pro play it you'll get better
Nakka101: yeah i have memorized a few games
Nakka101: i am still a beginner though
Nakka101: just started in january
gogogo12: i been playing for over a year and my rating gone a little bit up
Nakka101: someday i will catch you!
gogogo12: nice
Nakka101: play again sometime?
gogogo12: you do good for a beginner
Nakka101: thanks!
gogogo12: want to play 9x9?
Nakka101: sure!
gogogo12: or 19x19
Nakka101: i am actually kind of low on time so 9x9 sounds pretty good
