C[illiam.reddy: This is the first game where I actually know the rules
jv: In general corner-sides->center
jv: that's great!
jv: A lot of it at the beginning is just keep playing
illiam.reddy: so play the edges
illiam.reddy: ?

C[jv: with 25k being new and 9 d being the best
illiam.reddy: atleast I scored lol
jv: If it was a close game we would fill in a few more stones
illiam.reddy: I know i know but jeez I hardly know the rules
jv: no, that's fine, just making sure you know
jv: so if you're in a close game you keep playing
illiam.reddy: I know.
illiam.reddy: Can you end the game at any time?
jv: not really
jv: both players have to pass
illiam.reddy: OK just making sure
illiam.reddy: thanks man/woman!!!!
jv: You're welcome
jv: good luck and keep having fun
jv: try to play games against people about your level
