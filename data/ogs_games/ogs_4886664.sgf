C[jahu: thanks, this is similar to the bottom group
jahu: the same shape
Canonicalchoice: Indeed, but on top, I didn't have much choice :)
jahu: e9 might threathen my group there
jahu: but not sure
Canonicalchoice: I will be 1 move behind always it seems
jahu: I think I could still capture the four stonesand be safe
jahu: mm-m
jahu: the bottom group lived because I was greedy. I should have just leave it dead but I was afraid of the cut so I connected
Canonicalchoice: My mistake was move 12 I think
jahu: then attacked on the left but it looked like I would have difficult time then
Canonicalchoice: Yeah, with Komi, might still be close in that case
jahu: c6 was early I think
jahu: because then I got the atari at f2
Canonicalchoice: I thought I might be able to run at H6, which I didn't do
jahu: ah, that might be ok
Canonicalchoice: but yes, might have been early, I dunno
jahu: you most likely cannot live in sente so I would get the big point
jahu: so the earlier you know you can live the better
Canonicalchoice: i was thinking It could be early, but you know, experimentation :)
jahu: yeah
jahu: always good to try something new
Canonicalchoice: i made those all the time... 
Canonicalchoice: Anyway, thanks
jahu: even if it is a failure :) I was playing yesterday at our club and did something way too peculiar and it did not end well
jahu: yeah, thanks for the game
Canonicalchoice: haha
Canonicalchoice: I don't have a club, only play online..
jahu: I play mostly live only, here is surprisingly active club.
Canonicalchoice: I see! Anyway, see you around! I got to go
jahu: yeah, see you too
