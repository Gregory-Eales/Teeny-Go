C[bricmar: for a moment
bricmar: I fear that I'd have lost
bricmar: my advantadge
reinsor: yes, but you played a5
reinsor: you meant that moment?
reinsor: the mistake I've been making a lot recently is not connecting stones and then one chain gets captured....
bricmar: nope, I'm referring to your whole territory
bricmar: you managed to take a vast piece of board
reinsor: oh, but I had no chance, right?
bricmar: and I focused too much on take your group on the left corner
bricmar: yeah
bricmar: it was unlikely
bricmar: but at the end
bricmar: I wasn't playing that good
reinsor: I should have played b4 instead of b3
reinsor: no, not really good, but You almost couldn't lose
bricmar: you shouldn't play that much on the center
bricmar: it's more easy for the opponent
bricmar: to close you
bricmar: on the corner
bricmar: without giving enough room
bricmar: to make two eyes
reinsor: I will try the corners
reinsor: rematch?
bricmar: alright
bricmar: send me the challenge
