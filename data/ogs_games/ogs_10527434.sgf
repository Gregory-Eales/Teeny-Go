Justeliss: d8
Justeliss: i would have killed the e2 stone
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]

Justeliss: hmm
Justeliss: i dont think so
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]

metaphysician splurgist :): so c8 is no good atfer all
Justeliss: because of g7
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]

metaphysician splurgist :): well
metaphysician splurgist :): maybe it was d9 after all
metaphysician splurgist :): or not
Justeliss: no
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]

metaphysician splurgist :): was the connection
metaphysician splurgist :): with the big group
