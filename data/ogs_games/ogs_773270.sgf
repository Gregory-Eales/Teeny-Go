C[rberenguel: Crap! I hadn't realised it either. No idea: I have a tournamet game where it is 2.5 Another 9x9 nasty bug?
monospaced: I think they changed it after the update

C[rberenguel: Well, I've always thought (specially as black :D) that 6.5 is somewhat too much for 9x9
]
(;W[ci]
C[monospaced: but black also has quite some advantage in 9x9. I guess the change is to make 9x9 result independent of Japanese/Chinese rules

C[rberenguel: Ah, makes sense. I'm not sure about black's advantage, I think 4.5 (as supposedly suggested by Go Seigen after his two games against hmmm Hane Naoki IIRC)
