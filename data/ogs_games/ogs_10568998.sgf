Justeliss: your last
Justeliss: moce
Justeliss: move
metaphysician splurgist :): was not needed ?
Justeliss: yep
metaphysician splurgist :): oh
Justeliss: if i cut u just c5
metaphysician splurgist :): look
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Justeliss: white is dead
metaphysician splurgist :): yes i know
metaphysician splurgist :): but wasnt it quite dangerous ^^
Justeliss: nah
metaphysician splurgist :): really ?
Justeliss: not enough space for white
Justeliss: also
metaphysician splurgist :): so black was right to ignore the atari ^^
Justeliss: if white c5
Justeliss: black b5
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Justeliss: afer that black b4
metaphysician splurgist :): black b4 ?
Justeliss: yes
metaphysician splurgist :): lol we thought the same ^^
Justeliss: hehe
Justeliss: when white  d5 black cuts
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Justeliss: if white connects black connects
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Justeliss: if white c8 black connect i guess
Justeliss: c7
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): if he connects he has no eye ^^
Justeliss: he has
metaphysician splurgist :): show ^^
Justeliss: how to send a variation :D
metaphysician splurgist :): loool
metaphysician splurgist :): above chat
Justeliss: oh
metaphysician splurgist :): there is written
metaphysician splurgist :): variation name
metaphysician splurgist :): just write whatever name ^^
Justeliss: \[object Object\]
Justeliss: black is alive
Justeliss: white is dead
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): this would happen i think
Justeliss: on move 37 black must atari
metaphysician splurgist :): white still dead though ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): no ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): because atari leaves the corner
metaphysician splurgist :): for white
Justeliss: but it is safer
metaphysician splurgist :): and if white c4
metaphysician splurgist :): then black can c3
metaphysician splurgist :): safely
metaphysician splurgist :): you see ?
Justeliss: yeah
metaphysician splurgist :): c4 is uneeded
metaphysician splurgist :): better do c8 ^^
Justeliss: but if u atari u can still kill white
Justeliss: by going a7
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): the atari you did
metaphysician splurgist :): is worth nothing
metaphysician splurgist :): white can ignore it
metaphysician splurgist :): it gives no eye space
metaphysician splurgist :): white can c9
metaphysician splurgist :): for example
Justeliss: he cant ignore
Justeliss: i will take 2 stones
metaphysician splurgist :): then black a7
Justeliss: not one
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Justeliss: \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): atari or not ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Justeliss: yep
metaphysician splurgist :): black b9
metaphysician splurgist :): is a lot better ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): it allows path for c9
metaphysician splurgist :): safely ^^
Justeliss: well in the end white dies so there is not much of a difference :D
metaphysician splurgist :): i think its better ^^
Justeliss: i just wanted to tell u that your last move was useless :D
metaphysician splurgist :): i'm not so sure
metaphysician splurgist :): look
metaphysician splurgist :): it was quite close^^
Justeliss: yeah but still white is dead
Justeliss: no way to live
metaphysician splurgist :): thats not so obvious for me ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): black couldnt pass anytime
metaphysician splurgist :): he had to reply
Justeliss: yeah 
metaphysician splurgist :): then you'll tell me white had more score
metaphysician splurgist :): but !
metaphysician splurgist :): seek weaknesses ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): not score ^^
Justeliss: if this would be larger board this probably be dangerous
