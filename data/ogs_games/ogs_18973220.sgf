C[FrostedNuke: gg
Emily N.: cud u pls tell my weakness/mistakes?
FrostedNuke: \[object Object\]
Emily N.: hmm
FrostedNuke: what you did was just fine you were just a little behind on points by the end
Emily N.: hmm
Emily N.: how can i improve?
FrostedNuke: the hard thing about 9x9 is counting about how much you will have early enough to change the game
Emily N.: yep
FrostedNuke: i'm not sure how you would do in a harder fighting game
FrostedNuke: because this game was pretty peaceful
Emily N.: u were trying to be gentle with me?
FrostedNuke: have you started playing 19x19 yet?
FrostedNuke: no I wasn't, I was trying to win
Emily N.: no...it seems too big to me
FrostedNuke: white doesn't need to fight to win if black doesn't take enough
Emily N.: true
FrostedNuke: are you playing any ranked games?
Emily N.: no...shud i?
FrostedNuke: yeah because you are still at 25k
FrostedNuke: try ranking up and seeing where you get to
Emily N.: ok
FrostedNuke: if you get to 20k, just start playing 19x19
Emily N.: any mistakes u wud like to highlight?
FrostedNuke: in this game no
FrostedNuke: you did just fine, for the most part
FrostedNuke: maybe just ask for a little more. but at your level that is not that big a mistake
Emily N.: ok
Emily N.: thanks
FrostedNuke: how do you feel in complicated games
FrostedNuke: where groups may die
FrostedNuke: here nothing really was in danger of dieing
Emily N.: hmm
Emily N.: but i m bad with fighting..i think
Emily N.: i try to be safe
FrostedNuke: probably, it's not easy
Emily N.: for eg i m not agressive...u may have noted
FrostedNuke: yeah
FrostedNuke: want to play another game? I will try and start a fight in it
Emily N.: ok
Emily N.: maybe in 10 mins?
Emily N.: i need a short break
FrostedNuke: ok sure
Emily N.: :)
