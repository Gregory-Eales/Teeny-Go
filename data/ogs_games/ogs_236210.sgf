C[KlausP: As Illuck pointed out in the chat later, b can win with d4 here. The Ko wont help b much, cause he will loose the h6 stones in the ko.

C[KlausP: I think black can win here with e9. If w takes, the atari at h9 should do the trick. If w connects, b throws in at a8 and starts a Ko with a6. W looses cause he has no kothreats.
