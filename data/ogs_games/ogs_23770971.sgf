C[Bradicalman: arghh i had good positioning, just couldn't control the flow of the game at all
Rorimuha: But it was good work, you brought that to ive right above.. i was very sure that i could kill it XD
Bradicalman: haha i knew i could survive, i just wasn't sure if i could take any of the top right
Bradicalman: if i could have then i would have won likely
Bradicalman: top left*
