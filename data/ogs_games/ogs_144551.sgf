C[Imagist: This opening aims to take control of the board by splitting white up and attacking the separated groups.
There are two general strategies: play at a 3-5 point and then flexibly expanding to whichever corner black doesn't take, hoping to get a large enough single group, or play a 3-3 point, hoping to get enough room to invade in the opposite corner.

C[Imagist: This doesn't indicate a clear opening strategy.  You may take a large corner, but black will take the entire other side, and you will be forced to invade.  I can't say this is absolutely wrong, but as black I have a very high win ratio against this white play.

C[Imagist: White is forced to invade, creating two weak groups.

C[Imagist: Black gets lots of forcing moves on this group because it is weak.

C[Imagist: If white now plays H2 or H3 to live, the endgame (starting at D9) is favorable to black.

C[Imagist: The white group needs one more settling move.
