C[likebox: I didn't give you the rank, relax
likebox:  I think it's an AI thing
MXMLLN: I know.
MXMLLN: You played the most games with me though.
MXMLLN: It's not an AI, just part of the program.
likebox: I mean, an AI can determine your rank from your moves
likebox: In principle.
likebox: It can be quite accurate
MXMLLN: So can a simple algorithm.
likebox: But a win/loss algorithm isn't using move data.
MXMLLN: Right.
likebox: okay, I think I'm losing already
likebox: see, this is why I hate 44
MXMLLN: You're losing because you have komi.
likebox: ?

C[likebox: okay, gotta fight here
likebox: But you're SO STRONG
MXMLLN: White is compensated for its perceived loss in territory for starting second.
likebox: The AI used to say that 4 4 was the best opening
likebox: Yes, but the compensation is too low on 9x9
likebox: black starts with a large advantage according to AIs
likebox: fair komi is around 8 or so on 9x9
MXMLLN: 6.5 is proportionally a lot more points on such a small board.
MXMLLN: Oh, I never heard that.
likebox: right. But first move advantage is also bigger on a small board

C[likebox: I am going by the AIs on this site

likebox: I follow their recommendations after the game (if I can see it, I don't pay)

C[MXMLLN: Splitting is only relevant when the groups don't have eyes.

MXMLLN: You're D3 stone was technically also cut off before you split me in the upper right.
