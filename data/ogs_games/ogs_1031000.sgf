C[Stable: Happy New Year! I have to admit I've not been loving go (or any games) as much recently. I feel like I've got too much to do! That's a little sad in some ways. ;)

C[ba-yu: Did you unpause the game?
ba-yu: I suppose not. The unpause button is gone, so I expect some admin action on the UI.
ba-yu: The pause button is in the menu to the right. Maybe we just maxed out the pause.
Stable: No, I didn't touch it. I'm going to resign here though as I didn't see the double ko before. No way to win!
Stable: Thanks for the game, nice one.
ba-yu: Can you show me the double ko? I only see 2 versions of a direct ko (or a seki). I think that I can win the ko (enough threats against the lower right group).
ba-yu: Thanks for the game
ba-yu: Ah, now I see it. Sneaky.
ba-yu: Was there a reason why you didn't throw in at a5?
ba-yu: And, nope. Only direct ko.
ba-yu: Too tired, apparently.
Stable: yes, a5, c7, resign would be the sequence there ;)
Stable: oh I was looking at a6
Stable: I forget why, but I had a reason.
Stable: I had a huge sequence that would let me invade the top right and start a ko for the game somewhere but I lost it along the way and couldn't find it again...
Stable: Another?
