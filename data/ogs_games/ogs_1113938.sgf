C[antspants: Now we agree on which stones are dead.
antspants: In this case, I believe all of your black stones are dead :-)
antspants: In other words if we kept playing, they would be taken.
thixthipm3: I know that
thixthipm3: that is why i ask for another game
antspants: Right.  I thought you were clicking them to be alive.  The dead ones should be greyed out.
antspants: oh
antspants: ok we are successfully done with this game.
antspants: Now I will try creating a new game.
thixthipm3: How can I know your game
