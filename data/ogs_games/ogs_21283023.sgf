C[tsumani: sorry. But it worthed a shot.
Donec Perficiam: who cares
Donec Perficiam: just a game, mate
Donec Perficiam: thx
tsumani: according to the stats I can do on my games
tsumani: everyone ?
Donec Perficiam: what does that mean?
tsumani: that I have a ton of people with a lesser rank than mine coming to play my games
Donec Perficiam: me too
tsumani: once in a while, I have a better player
tsumani: Funny thing is 
Donec Perficiam: I lost several games with 18  and less lost in the last few days
tsumani: when you win a ranked game against a +6 kyu, you earn a lot of rank 
tsumani: but i,s only a coincidence 
Donec Perficiam: I'm just playing for fun now
tsumani: Sure
tsumani: playing wekar players is no fun on OGS I assume
Donec Perficiam: trying to get to my 9 or 10 kyu rank gives me too much stress
Donec Perficiam: people lose huge groups in the beginning of the game and don't have the decendy to resign
Donec Perficiam: it≈õ utterly frustrating
tsumani: as you say
Donec Perficiam: If I lose a group of 10 or more stones at the beginning I resign and move on. Nobody does that anymore
Donec Perficiam: they string you along until you make a mistake
Donec Perficiam: ok, bye now
Donec Perficiam: thax for the game
tsumani: bye
