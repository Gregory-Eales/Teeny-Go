C[GoForProfit: Microcode Engineer!
Real Clock: but you program it in VHDL or Verilog 
GoForProfit: very cool
Real Clock: I'm engineer in Communication Technology 
GoForProfit: Do people still use APL to programming logic arrays?
Real Clock: and I use uC and FPGAs 
Real Clock: APL ?
Real Clock: what is that? :)
GoForProfit: APL - A Programming Language - from ancient time like 1980's...
GoForProfit: reverse polish notation
Real Clock: ou. No. VHDL is a Hardware Description Language standard
GoForProfit: parsing from right to left, by read from left to right
GoForProfit: too advanced pour moi now
Real Clock: so people use it. ...it's like describing hardware as logic.
Real Clock: AND OR NOT etc.
GoForProfit: But that is everything... 
GoForProfit: from image processing to bio statistics, to AI to data mining
Real Clock: yeah :) it also have Architecture Behavior description. With it you can use such constructs as in C 
GoForProfit: thanks for playing GO, and sharing about uC and VHDL
Real Clock: thank you too :)
GoForProfit: exit();
Real Clock: ;)
