C[Tarqeq: I misread
Tarqeq: so you are a beginner, eh?
poorgo: almost 3month
Tarqeq: there are professional players who play for a year or two
Tarqeq: time does not make you beginner
Tarqeq: and you made this ranked?
Tarqeq: /me sighs
poorgo: beginner is 1k.i think
Tarqeq: beginner is 25 k
Tarqeq: 1k is just before 1d
Tarqeq: it is reversed for kyu and dan levels
poorgo: i am set wring
Tarqeq: yup
Tarqeq: but not as wrong
poorgo: i learn by myself by net
Tarqeq: you dont do beginner mistakes, really
poorgo: my country is poor
Tarqeq: well, could be worse, but most post-Soviet republics are
poorgo: we talking in chat
