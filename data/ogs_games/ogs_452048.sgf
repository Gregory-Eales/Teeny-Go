C[Leira: Came to the ladder for this
Leira: not dissapointed!
Leira: Have a nice game
boredom: Now you get to see how much I fail at 9x9! Welcome to the game!

C[Leira: Fail or not, it was no short trip climbing up here. I had to win 3 or 4 people on the way.
Leira: apparently the ladder is not reasonably distributed rankwise though
Leira: I was able to challenge only 15k+, and tough that makes me feel like a sandbagger, I had a clear target in my mind
Leira: mwahahahahaha
Leira: they were causalities to a greater war :P

(;B[ce]
C[boredom: Yes it isn't uncommon for low ranks to get really high up the ladder, it seems.
boredom: I think part of it is they may play a lot of 9x9 and get good at local fights, but not the big picture of 19x19 boards.

(;W[cg]
C[Leira: or challenged someone who times out, that is not uncommon either
]
(;B[dg]
C[boredom: Oh I didn't even thing of that. Good point.
boredom: But some of them kick my ass in 9x9, and I'm not sure if it is more because they are good at it or if it is because I am bad at it.
boredom: Wow that sentence had a lot of two-letter words...

C[boredom: Thank you for the game!
Leira: Thank you
Leira: as always
boredom: You remain the ladder champ
boredom: But I will have my revenge
Leira: I thought I had lost when you managed to live on that corner
boredom: I thought you had too, to be honest.
Leira: rule of thumb: two separate white groups is a win for white
boredom: Then I realized you won shortly after that
boredom: I've actually been losing a good deal of 9x9 as white with two groups, lately XD
Leira: huh, that is weird
boredom: Or enough that I feel like I've been, anyways.
Leira: shouldn't happen all that often
boredom: I am a special person
Leira: then again, I've been winning a few 9x9 as white with only one group :P
boredom: My head is trying to shut down.
boredom: Goodnight Leira!
Leira: goodnight boredom
Leira: see you soon
