C[hdci: However, as soon as I was in B5 your b3-d4 group was dead. Instead of b6 you should have played b5, but still I was leading.
hdci: Anyway, I made a mistake when I played d5 : I should have played c6, because you couldn't cut my stones (see variation)
hdci: \[object Object\]
hdci: Now, I wonder why you didn't play h5 instead of j6 ?
hdci: \[object Object\]
