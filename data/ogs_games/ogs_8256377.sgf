C[GoAinue: ok how am i supposed to take advantage of this
Rlim: ah there we go
Rlim: well what if I were to play on lets say g4
Rlim: where would you go next?
GoAinue: i don't know
GoAinue: i've been playing around with different moves but i don't know what's actually good
Rlim: what if white g4, black g6?
GoAinue: oh when i do that, my opponents usually take the top left
GoAinue: with c6, c7, or d7
Rlim: tbh, you don't have to strictly go for the tengen, you can open at d6 for example.  the board is so small that playing on something like c7 is rather small
Rlim: ok let's try this
Rlim: i mean if he plays at the top
GoAinue: oh actually there's an opening explorer
Rlim: don't you think you can split him?
GoAinue: hold on let me link
GoAinue: it's just that it doesn't go into detail so i need a pro to help me understand why those moves get played
Rlim: but I'm not a pro >.>
GoAinue: https://online-go.com/puzzle/181
Rlim: might be easier on a demo board lol
GoAinue: hm, do you think we should do voice?
GoAinue: i don't have a mic but i have earphones i can listen?
Rlim: but tbh i wouldn't stress too much on openings in 9x9 or 13x13
GoAinue: i think understanding why the moves get played will help my understanding of tactics though
Rlim: when we talk about small boards, it's more on tactics like cutting your opponent, etc.
Rlim: hm ok
GoAinue: want to do voice chat?
Rlim: oh im already in
GoAinue: kk i'll type in discord
Rlim: you could type here 
Rlim: welp discord is lagging hold on
