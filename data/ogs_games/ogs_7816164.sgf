C[foobar4: yes i get 0 points
foobar4: wow!
m00sin: thanks for the game!
foobar4: nice!
foobar4: the funny thing is other than at the start i ddin't feel like i played horribly, so hats off to you
m00sin: hmm no you didn't
foobar4: you are good at killing my eyeshape
m00sin: i think the best piece of advice I've gotten for 9x9 games is to try and keep your groups to 2
m00sin: 3 groups are too many to try and keep alive
foobar4: yes i was trying to but also to make distance so taking 1 point jumps
foobar4: but it backfired
foobar4: anyways thanks for the game
m00sin: thank you!
