C[08ebw.williams: Gg
greenUserman: Thank you for the game.
greenUserman: Have a nice day.
08ebw.williams: Same.
greenUserman: Do you think you started out with a disadvantage when you conceded three corners in the opening or do you think the difference was built in the middlegame?
greenUserman: I thought your opening choice was very interesting. It led to a fun game.
