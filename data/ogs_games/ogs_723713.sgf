hikaru1no1go: i was gonna play at j8 after he play h9
hikaru1no1go: but rikhon just said to play at j8 before
hikaru1no1go: lol
hikaru1no1go: rikhon
hikaru1no1go: no
hikaru1no1go: how is it
hikaru1no1go: suicide
hikaru1no1go: ?
Action Thew: snapback tentative
Action Thew: ha no
herbie: lol
Rikhon: hikaru the specialist :3
herbie: lol
Rikhon: man -_- learn how to break spirit of opponent from this kid :V
Action Thew: that move 33 was really good from black
Action Thew: white did not try to read further
herbie: I like black j8
Action Thew: hikaru why are you 29k you were 27 k befoore no ?
Rikhon: he lost some 19x19 game :D
Rikhon: he is noob at 19x19
Action Thew: hmm
Action Thew: ok
Rikhon: hikaru challenge flowing :D
Action Thew: you should play 19x19
Action Thew: thats the real game
Rikhon: he will help u a teaching game
Rikhon: i tell him always
flowing: herbie, j8 was -1 point in gote
Rikhon: to play in 19x19 even if he lose all game
herbie: -1 point in gote?
flowing: black was losing one point and white got a free move
Action Thew: yes play 19x19 and when you are fed up of losing you play a 99 and then back to 19x19
Rikhon: play 19x19 game full without resigning ... learn from ur opponent
flowing: means bad move
herbie: oh
flowing: hikaru, we never played
Rikhon: liar
Rikhon: 19x19
Rikhon: ??
flowing: nope
herbie: I was just thinking that if white had been provoked into trying to atari he would have lost all the stones in that group
flowing: searched profile - "hika" -> no results
Rikhon: u didnt play flowing
herbie: \[object Object\]
Rikhon: hikaru played more game than me :D
herbie: I probably would have done that as white >.>
Rikhon: but 9x9
Rikhon: and i played few less than him only 19x19
flowing: herbie, the white stones are already dead, so black doesn't need to do anything
Rikhon: sorry :D
herbie: Yes, I see that now
flowing: good :)
Action Thew: like the giant group in my game yesterday herbie you remember :p
Action Thew: they are dead
herbie: lol
flowing: after lots of tsumego you start to notice on thing or two :)
herbie: Tsumego are haaard
flowing: hikaru, why do you kill dead groups then? :3
herbie: I always seem to find all the wrong answers lol
Action Thew: lol flowing
flowing: j8
Action Thew: white couldnt live anyway there was no need to put j8
flowing: of course, if white plays j8 black h9 and other way round
herbie: I think he probably just saw the possibility of a straight four and blocked it
herbie: straight three
Action Thew: if not h9 then no j8 if no j8 then no h9
Rikhon: hmm o.O j8 not a bad move i want to say
flowing: \[object Object\]
flowing: \[object Object\]
Rikhon: j8 not a bad move >_<
flowing: rikhon, it's -1point in gote, it's like the definition of a bad move
Rikhon: its an advanced move @_@
herbie: Basically, you
Rikhon: kk wait
herbie: you're saying if white doesn't play h9 to try to make a living group
herbie: black shouldn't play j8
Action Thew: yes herbie
Rikhon: \[object Object\]
herbie: But white shouldn't try to make a living group anyways because he can't beat black to the vital point
Rikhon: j8 okay
flowing: rikhon, why should white play 2?
flowing: white could play h9 as kothreat
flowing: but that's all
Rikhon: hmm i see
Rikhon: kk u win -_-
Rikhon: i think i solved too many tsumega today :V
herbie: lol
flowing: i should do some
herbie: Rikhon: shouldn't white just block the cutting points in your variation?
LinuxGooo: here I am
LinuxGooo: whats going ?
LinuxGooo: :-)
herbie: Hey LinuxGooo
LinuxGooo: did hikaru suprise with some crazy moves ? :-)
LinuxGooo: hello, herbie
LinuxGooo: hikaru already gone, hm 
herbie: We were debating the validity of b j8 xD
herbie: Us lower kyus couldn't see why it was a bad move lol
LinuxGooo: j8, hm ?
LinuxGooo: \[object Object\]
LinuxGooo: white had no more threads
herbie: \[object Object\]
LinuxGooo: so J8 could have been played later
herbie: Well, sure, but that's a totally different game xD
LinuxGooo: yes, E3 s risky
LinuxGooo: but I think, better than playing G4
herbie: Oh, I was talking about the actual 17, ie G4
LinuxGooo: E 3 i streathening white's left sde
herbie: G4 could have been suicide
LinuxGooo: yes, thats Hikaru's harakiri style
herbie: lol
LinuxGooo: \[object Object\]
flowing: linux, black4 on f3
LinuxGooo: whats with black F3 ?
flowing: it's way saner than playing j4
flowing: j5 *
flowing: moment
flowing: that was another variation
LinuxGooo: yes, F4 was needed for black after G4
flowing: sorry, clicked on herbies
flowing: anyway, i'm out :)
herbie: haha, you're right xD
LinuxGooo: \[object Object\]
LinuxGooo: F3 could have provoked white to turn the side
LinuxGooo: and expanding right side, instead of bottom side
LinuxGooo: \[object Object\]
LinuxGooo: and heavily lost
LinuxGooo: it will come the time, when hikaru will play with stronger players and learn that his harakiri-style isnt very successfully
LinuxGooo: :-)
LinuxGooo: bet he learns by burning his fingers 
LinuxGooo: bst
LinuxGooo: best dam*** keyboard
herbie: *best =P
LinuxGooo: ok, I am out
herbie: k bye o/
LinuxGooo: see you
