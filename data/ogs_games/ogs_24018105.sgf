katrain-weighted: W A5 caused a significant score change (B gained 2.4 points) -> Win Rate W 99.8% Score W+25.5 AI Thoughts: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are B6 (32.50%), A5 (23.40%), B5 (23.05%), B7 (9.10%), D1 (7.80%). Playing policy-weighted random move A5 (23.4%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=0.10%, num moves > lb=14).
