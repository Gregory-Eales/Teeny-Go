C[joellercoaster: I think I have now lost about a dozen games of 9x9 in a row. Clearly I am missing something!
Ingrid: 9x9 feels like a completely different game to me -- kind of like it's a game of go that's only corners!

C[joellercoaster: Exactly - I'm making progress in "normal Go" but my ability to play 9x9 lags way behind.
joellercoaster: But hopefully I can assemble all these losses into something reviewable and try and figure out something useful :)

C[Ingrid: I have a friend who's stronger who might be willing to review the game, if you'd like....  I definitely felt I got away with too much here, and I'm not sure how I should have played either.  My sense is that 3,3 points can be good in the beginning (since there isn't time to build large frameworks), but then taking two 3,3 points in the beginning has also landed me in a lot of trouble!

C[joellercoaster: A review would definitely be welcome. I feel like posting a collection of my 9x9 losses to L19 and asking them, "what am I missing here?"
joellercoaster: My 9x9 hoodoo is definitely real.
joellercoaster: I can't see any way of fighting my way out here, no matter how unlikely. A3 was basically a really terrible idea.
joellercoaster: Thank you for the game!
