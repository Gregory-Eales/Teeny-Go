C[DanCasas-Murray: Hi KyleLee
DanCasas-Murray: I'm a beginner and saw you had many opportunities to fight during the game
DanCasas-Murray: but it seemed that you didn't do that - you used tactics to gain more territories
DanCasas-Murray: is that correct?
DanCasas-Murray: but I also saw at the beginning you didn't seem to mind too much about not connecting stones right away.
