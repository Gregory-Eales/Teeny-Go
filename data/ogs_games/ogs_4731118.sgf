C[DVD9: white's behind?
Real Clock: black. But after this move, i don't know
Real Clock: well i can let you in at E3 and if black at the right bottom corner survives, white will lose miserably 
Real Clock: Well of course E3 will be traded with E8
Real Clock: but the thing is, black doesn't survive :))) 
DVD9: yeah, e4 is foricn move
DVD9: *forcing
Real Clock: yeah, now black loses by 1.5
DVD9: not sure... 
Real Clock: well D8 spot is very dangerous - true :) 
Real Clock: 1d+ or so, would probably invade and somehow make a few forcing moves, but I would just die measurably

C[Real Clock: but yeah E3 is forcing 
DVD9: you beat me before.).

DVD9: watchin a movie at the same time.). 
Real Clock: simulating VHDL code at the same time =P 
Real Clock: it's a language for Hardware description 
DVD9: cool... 
Real Clock: used mainly for FPGA (something like micro-controllers, but not really )
Real Clock: it takes sometimes hours to simulate the code ..:(

C[Real Clock: there are to many sequences I want to sleep :) But i think black should win this way. The push at E9 gave +2 points or so
