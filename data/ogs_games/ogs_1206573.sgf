C[Arcos: XD
Arcos: lol
The Almighty God: :)
Arcos: gg mate
The Almighty God: Well played
The Almighty God: Why did you give up? 
The Almighty God: It was the same situation like before, except that i have a living group !
Arcos: Well
Arcos: I'm not entirely sure :P
The Almighty God: I think you could have easily attacked at F3 or something like that
Arcos: I was thinking that after I resigned
The Almighty God: The only problem for you atm is that White C5 works and cuts!
Arcos: Yeah
Arcos: And with the thickness from your group I would be scared of what could happen
The Almighty God: Yeah, i just thought there were possible options to make decent territory...
Arcos: Though I think maybe if I played e6 I could've stopped the c5
The Almighty God: But that would give me the bottom right corner
The Almighty God: You mean this?
The Almighty God: \[object Object\]
Arcos: Yes
Arcos: though I'd lose the corner like you said
Arcos: All in all I was genuinely laughing so I didn't feel too bad about resigning there.
The Almighty God: ^^ Ok
Arcos: GG :)
The Almighty God: gg, see you ^^
