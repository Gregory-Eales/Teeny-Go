C[lidlba: thank you for the game but sorry about the result
lxopzqoxl: THANKS
lxopzqoxl: where r u from?
lidlba: France
lidlba: and you ?
lxopzqoxl: taiwan
lidlba: oh cool :)
lidlba: tropical island
lidlba: he I wanted to split the stone from the rest 
lxopzqoxl: You are a professional chess player?
lidlba: in 9x9 games, if you split the opponent in two groups, it's harder for him to survive and have points
lidlba: oh no I'm not a professional at all at any game ^^'
lidlba: that move (G5) is alright
lidlba: but not this one
lidlba: because I can split your stones (
lidlba: this forces me to try surviving with the two stones on the right
lidlba: but it doesn't work like this for black
lxopzqoxl: i'm new
lidlba: at go ? 
lidlba: (go, igo, weiki, baduk, whatever)
lxopzqoxl: Still learning
lidlba: yes, everyone is always learning :)
lidlba: but don't worry, with time and practice you will get better
lidlba: I'm not that strong... 6-7k is not a good level ^^'
lidlba: you should play against 9-10k players
lxopzqoxl: thanks for your encouragement
lxopzqoxl: OK
lidlba: and maybe whatch lessons in chinese etc :)
lidlba: you will progress quickly I'm sure
lidlba: anyway
lidlba: I guess that's all here :)
lidlba: thank you for your time
lxopzqoxl: YOU TOO
lxopzqoxl: BYE
lidlba: and have a nice day (or night I guess)
