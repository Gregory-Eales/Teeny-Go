C[rpswanson3: There's no way I'm recovering. I don't know know of I did so badly because of the lesser handicap or just major blunders. Probably both with an emphasis on the latter.

NominRamen: If you had fixed the peep here, bottom right becomes "seki". W cannot kill b and b cannot kill w. In such a case both groups are considered alive
NominRamen: Those are the main things. Gg! You had me beat until you resigned
NominRamen: Can you understand the "W's group in the corner is dead" variation? Or at least, can you see at the end that it is dead?
