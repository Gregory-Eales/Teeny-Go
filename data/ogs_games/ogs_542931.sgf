JoyofGo: Thank you for the game.
JoyofGo: I think this is the trouble. The stones are overconcentrated.
JoyofGo: They point in this direction, but it's just too easy for me to make life in the other corners.
JoyofGo: This would probably be most efficient sort of thing.
JoyofGo: And then use your other stone to attack/build later.
JoyofGo: This stone needs to build or attack, and doesn't stand on its own. 
JoyofGo: But the attack shouldn't be too condensed. You need to take as much as you can as quickly as you can early in the game to shape the flow.
