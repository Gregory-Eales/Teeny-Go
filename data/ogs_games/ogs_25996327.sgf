C[festosoon: Good game; good invasion
simonjin: Good Gaem
festosoon: What do you mean you "realized that \[you\] would have to know them all down the side of the cage"?
festosoon: knock
festosoon: To get them off the paper?
simonjin: The ant would crawl up the sides of the lizard cage
simonjin: and get away
festosoon: ooooooo
festosoon: The cage doesn't have a lid?
simonjin: Yes but it could crawl though there are small holes
festosoon: Or could you put some mesh with smaller holes on the top?
simonjin: I not sure if we have any but that is an idea
festosoon: What else did you do, or what else happened while you were in Flagstaff?
simonjin: I'll ask my mom to text a picture of the lizards
simonjin: Well...
festosoon: Good idea
festosoon: Well I went to teacher training at Glendale Prep and taught two days of online school yesterday and today!
simonjin: I went to petrified forest, walnut canyon, oak creek canyon, hiked on different trails, played games at the hotel went in the hotel pool, and drank my mix of apple juice and strawberry water.
simonjin: nice
simonjin: di you like it?
simonjin: did
festosoon: THAT sounds like fun - that is a vacation I would enjoy :-)
festosoon: What did you think of the petrified forest?
simonjin: I was expecting live trees among the dead/petrified trees and because of that is would be shadier
simonjin: but it was cool
festosoon: Isnâ€™t it amazing that a tree can turn into a rock!
simonjin: I want to see a rock turn in to a tree
festosoon: That WOULD be something too - maybe it just takes 10s of thousands of years like the tree turning into a rock
simonjin: maybe
simonjin: my mom sent you the picture
simonjin: s
festosoon: Ok thx
festosoon: The first two days of school were good
festosoon: I really like all my coworkers and my students all seem nice so far :-)
simonjin: What books are you reading ing class
simonjin: or going to read
festosoon: Right now we are reading the Iliad in 11th grade and the Aeneid in 12th grade
simonjin: Noah and my dad are finishing up the Aeneid
festosoon: The story of the Aeneid takes place right after the story of the Iliad, but it was written almost 1000 years later!
festosoon: Are they liking it?
simonjin: They like the Iliad and the Odyssey
simonjin: better
festosoon: Yeah, most people agree, but the Aenid has some special moments and qualities
simonjin: My dad agrees
