C[foxcub: I don't think so either.
EatenAlive3: It's useful on 19x19 for its influence towards center
foxcub: But I'm trying it to figure out how it works.
foxcub: Right, that's my understanding as well.

C[EatenAlive3: Use it on 19x19 or if you can actually perfect a strategy for it here, use it :P
EatenAlive3: Even the center point is good here, it's weird on 9x9 :D

foxcub: One more?
foxcub: Without the 4-4
EatenAlive3: Sure. 3-3 or 3-4 is best
