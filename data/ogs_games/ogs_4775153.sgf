C[nomadfarmer: yo
Xi Jinping: Heya, good luck
nomadfarmer: thought I'd catch up on that challenge from the other day
Xi Jinping: Let's play 19x19, then

C[nomadfarmer: Sure. I've been playing 9x9s today because I've discovered I suck at them
Xi Jinping: Yeah, I can tell
nomadfarmer: And I'm pretty sure it's highlighted the worst parts of my game :o)

C[nomadfarmer: would you be interested in starting a small discord or skype chat with like 4-8 folks around our levels to be study partners?
nomadfarmer: Or at least encourage each other
]
(;B[dc]
C[Xi Jinping: Yes, totally, but my interest in it stems from competing with others
Xi Jinping: You know, like to see who can rise the fastest...and also to play games against friendly people you already know well etc.
nomadfarmer: that's actually one of the things I think could help me
]
(;W[cg]
C[nomadfarmer: Exactly. I'm not usually that sort of competitive... but if I had someone who I used to beat who starts beating me it could help me :o)
Xi Jinping: I will probably be joining AYD this season, though
Xi Jinping: Starting i May

C[nomadfarmer: cool
nomadfarmer: I think Meien said in chat that the may season actually starts Apr 25th this year

C[nomadfarmer: oh, heh, G2 was a semi-mistake. I did the thing I do in correspondence games where I set the stone down and then read from there
Xi Jinping: Please make more mistakes
Xi Jinping: I was way way behind in this game before C3 invasion
Xi Jinping: So everything after C3 was hail mary
nomadfarmer: yeah, I was happy with the opening

C[nomadfarmer: I played a 9x9 with mark5000 the other day in which he told me that in 9x9s the opening is king

C[Xi Jinping: Yep
Xi Jinping: And every stone is sacred
nomadfarmer: unlike 19x19s when it's the middle game
Xi Jinping: Thanks for the 9x9
nomadfarmer: Anyway... if I start some sort of group, do you have a preferred medium?
Xi Jinping: Doesn't matter to me
Xi Jinping: I prefer chat though, it's asych
Xi Jinping: asynch*
nomadfarmer: -nod- Well, I'm interested in something that's like a group chat/text on the phone... you can check in whenever but whoever wants to chat or go over something can
nomadfarmer: I'm in a poker group like that on discord
nomadfarmer: And a health related one on whatsapp
nomadfarmer: thanks for the game
nomadfarmer: whoa, we had an audience
Xi Jinping: Take care :)
