C[slowfox: oh shit! you are such a tricky player! so disgusting!

C[slowfox: actually I hate the 9x9 games against you. You are such a tricky man. In 19x19 you  could not play like this.

C[slowfox: really, lousy trick player!
ssx: i find 19x19 harder. i didn't found my strategy and i try a lot of things :)

C[slowfox: it annoyes me. Last game you have won by 1,5 points only due to a mistake from me. Now I made again a mistake.
ssx: well, in 9x9, i already won against a 6k player :D
slowfox: I am furious! I could kill your lousy play!
slowfox: But the good player wins on 19x19. I ahgver won 5 times against 6-9k players already
slowfox: this game is s h i t !
slowfox: Please if possible, don't play again against me 9x9. I disgust your tricky manner!
slowfox: And I disgust loosing agasinst weaker players ionly because of my mistakes.

C[slowfox: you see, I am a lousy player who does not even read GO books
ssx: how many times did you play go?
ssx: i'm like you. i don't like theory
slowfox: Sorry for my emotion. Our last 2 9x9 games have upset me already, because I have lost them only because of mistakes.
ssx: i admit that winning only by komi is not very nice
slowfox: I am playing since a month on this site. Before I have played the last time in the late 1970's in a club
slowfox: family, children, divorce, illness ect have fogotten me to play GO for more than 30 years. You see I am already old. And you?
