C[AlexandrS: Thanks, good game!
BunboHue: You sure want to pass?
BunboHue: You still need D9 and C7 to wrap up your territory
BunboHue: My group at A9 is alive, you need to throw a stone to capture it.

C[AlexandrS: A9 doesn't have 2 eyes. Yes, I want to pass

(;B[]
C[BunboHue: Hmm but this is capture Go. So if you want to capture my A9, you need to throw a stone to kill it
BunboHue: But if you throw a stone, I will capture it first. There is a reason for me to try to make a group without 2 eyes. 
BunboHue: 2 eyes do not mean anything in Capture Go

(;W[]
C[AlexandrS: The rules are - if you capture you win, if noone captures, the game goes as usual. The points count as usual game

(;B[]
C[BunboHue: Keep in mind that this changes the way you play completely. For example, a group that has a single two-territory eye is alive because the other player would have to sacrifice a stone – and therefore the game – to kill the group. Naturally, there is no such thing as a ko or a snapback.
BunboHue: Here from the description of the tournament
BunboHue: So my group at the left corner has 2 liberty

C[BunboHue: And it's alive
AlexandrS: Ok, I see your point. Let's wait for the admin decision.
AlexandrS: Thanks, it was informative)
BunboHue: Thanks :)))
