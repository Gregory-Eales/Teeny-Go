C[rpswanson3: So that time you were invading the NW, and you mentioned in the past that corners and edges tend to favor Invaders, so I tried to pry you out and into the center where I already had some strength
rpswanson3: Was that reasonable?

C[NominRamen: Yep! Althought it can be situational. Sometimes it is best to give the corner in exchange for the wall you het by surrounding it.
NominRamen: Prying the corner usually means you want to kill the group

C[NominRamen: Nice conditional moves :D
NominRamen: Glad you could see those sequences
NominRamen: Also, way to go from losing every stone to curb stomping me after just 1 game o.O
