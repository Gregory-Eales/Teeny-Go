C[monster1: thanks so much for joining
mgeorg: Thanks....I should have known you knew what you were doing with J line :)
monster1: I hope you'll enjoy the whole process
monster1: if you want to analyse this game ... we can
mgeorg: I actually enjoy losing well much better than most other games :)
mgeorg: I'd love to
monster1: you learn more when you lose ...
monster1: accept the stones and we can review
monster1: we'll have to do it later ... people are wainting now
monster1: waiting
mgeorg: Good hint about the g h j line.  I guess that's why it's a pretty strong technique against beginners :)
mgeorg: Sorry hadn't realized I hadn't accepted yet
monster1: good luck with wawa
