C[Thuruk: so i just passed when i should've fixed the center... hmm partially blind
Thuruk: shit
Thuruk: sorry
Thuruk: can a mod undo that
Thuruk: fuck my life i'm out of this
Thuruk: i feel bad if i accept this as a tournament victory
Thuruk: he said it's okay in private
Thuruk: but towards the others...
Thuruk: doesn't matter there's always a next one
Azunjau: yep, and black should not have passed -_-
ST000MA: lol
Azunjau: uh
ST000MA: yes
ST000MA: fran will fix the scores, just ask him to do it
demosha: White'd win by .5 pts :o
pathogenix: I don't understand
calantir: don't understand what?
pathogenix: what does black need to fix?
pathogenix: Oh, I see
calantir: Black can play D4 still
pathogenix: 'salright :D
pathogenix: yeah, white wins by 0.5 but the score wasn't correct because the territory wasn't closed
calantir: still no need for thuruk to quit the tournament, that's a little extreme
pathogenix: yeah, agreed
pathogenix: Just play a rematch and be friends :)
