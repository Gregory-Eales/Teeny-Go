C[Azrael: Maybe this move was a mistake. Attching to your opponent only makes it stronger especially during the edge. I was fortuante to get anything.

C[Rena: All of the moves thus far I've seen in a pro 9x9 game... I think their conclusion was that this move was a mistake, but I obviously failed to punish it properly!

C[Rena: Originally I had a plan here. I later forgot it and could not find anything that worked for me! I should have played B5 I think. White C4, black D7, white E6 then the tesuji at B8.

C[Azrael: May be if you played at H2 you coulhave had a chance to kill my group. Thanks for the game anyway.
Rena: Yeah, I looked at it for a while, but I didn't think it worked. Thanks!
