C[qriboh: oh, close game!
qriboh: ah, thanks alpha-152 for the variations!
qriboh: yep, the general ideas are still my biggest problems in 9x9-go ;)

Alpha-152: There are some mistakes in my vars.
Alpha-152: It was more about the general idea and direction.
Alpha-152: Try to contain the healthiest enemy group and kill off the rest.
