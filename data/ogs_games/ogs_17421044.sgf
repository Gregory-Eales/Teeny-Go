C[botija: Gracias por la partida.
M87: ?
botija: Thanks for the game
M87: Again 
M87: ?
M87: Because I do not undertsand
M87: you thank me for what ?
botija: For playing the game with me
M87: Usually, people are happy from the start, you just start being polite once you have assured victory
M87: I don't understand
M87: say "gracias por la victoria que me acabas de dar", it'll be more senseful
botija: Hubiera agradecido igual si hubiera perdido
M87: Sure
M87: this is the way it works
M87: waiting for your opponent's defeat to "show some respect"
M87: telling him whatever you want to
M87: "I would have done it anyway, you have to trust me on that"
M87: lol
botija: Que tengas un buen d√≠a / noche
