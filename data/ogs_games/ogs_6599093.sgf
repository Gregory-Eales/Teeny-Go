50 kyu: bug
metadelta: around c5
metadelta: i had "error submitting move"
metadelta: i refreshed the page and proceeded as normal
metadelta: it was right before d5 actually
50 kyu: we both pass, my blue button "accept" didn't work, I refreshed page, it worked for both after that, but game still not ended, resign didn't work
emauton: Hm, it seems to be ended by timeout
emauton: There was trouble in scoring?
emauton: Yeah. I'll report this one to the developers, they might be able to untangle what happened
emauton: Can you describe exactly what happened?
emauton: OK
emauton: Thanks very much for describing everything clearly, this should help the developer.
emauton: I'll report the game and note that the chat log has extra detail. Thanks again! o/
