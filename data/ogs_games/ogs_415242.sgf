C[JS23: wow, this new server is pretty neat.
Strategist: Indeed. It looks much micer than before.
Strategist: It looks like the new IGS.

C[JS23: haven't seen the IGS myself, but if it's like this it must be nice.

C[Strategist: IGS is great for 19x19 real-time games. I do not think they even have 9x9 option.

C[Strategist: Their new client is GoPanda2.
JS23: oh? well i prefer 19x19 anyway. 
JS23: GoPanda2? 
Strategist: My prefered server for real-time games is IGS; for correspondence games, OGS, especially now that it is upgraded.

C[JS23: does IGS make you download the client in order to play live games?
JS23: like KGS?
Strategist: Yes, you have to download the client. It is also Java based.

C[JS23: Bleh, not sure why, but that turned me off to live gaming. I think I'll stick to OGS.

C[JS23: dude, same here. i freakin' hate how claustrophobic (sp?) this board is.
Strategist: Also, because it is so small, you assume there must be a winning strategy but you cannot find it.

C[Strategist: 6.5 komi is quite a lot for such a small board.
JS23: very true. I agree, it's starting to look my favor. I wouldn't say it's over just yet, though.

Strategist: Thank you for the game.
JS23: you're welcome. feel free to challenge me anytime (on a bigger board, preferably)
Strategist: Sure. We'll play soon.
JS23: cool. later.
