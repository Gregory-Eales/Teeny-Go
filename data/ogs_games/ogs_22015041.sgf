C[greenplayingblack: yeah, wrong order but still not enough
greenplayingblack: thanks gg
Hugosaki: the left group was dead after move... 
Hugosaki: g7
Hugosaki: \[object Object\]
Hugosaki: \[object Object\]
Hugosaki: \[object Object\]
greenplayingblack: Yeah, I was thinking about going around while treating and letting right group die. Long shot.
greenplayingblack: * threatening
Hugosaki: Hmm yeah could have been sound reasoning 
greenplayingblack: Perhaps but still not enough, fun though 
Hugosaki: Yes 
Hugosaki: I was thinking
Hugosaki: \[object Object\]
Hugosaki: But maybe does not work either
greenplayingblack: I was thinking about G5, but I didn't think you would play H3
Hugosaki: Think that was necessary there, other moves would have made it problematioc
Hugosaki: Anyhow, thanks for the gaem
Hugosaki: See you later
Hugosaki: bye!
greenplayingblack: Take care
