C[timhunt: Thanks.
Joel Barrett: thanks for the game!
timhunt: Nice to konw that all those years of doing life and death problems paid off.
timhunt: If you don't play F8, then the corner is a ko. F8 makes it die outright.
Joel Barrett: Yeah, I need to do more tsumego :/
Joel Barrett: Ah, yes, I see.
timhunt: I was not quite sure who would win the ko, but at worst I get 2 moves elsewhere (hopefully)
Joel Barrett: Oh well, partial revenge for you :) I'm sure the next 19x19 will probably be your win!
timhunt: I'm not sure at all.
