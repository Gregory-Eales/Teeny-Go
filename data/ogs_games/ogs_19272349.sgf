C[FeFiFoFum: Ty gg
tommygun: that was exciting
tommygun: thank you
FeFiFoFum: I really felt I had a favorable position
tommygun: \[object Object\]
FeFiFoFum: Looks painful
tommygun: heh, yah, you made me prove that ignore my D3 and C6 moves weren't a good idea :( 
tommygun: making me work for myself huh
tommygun: \[object Object\]
FeFiFoFum: Yea
FeFiFoFum: Maintains connection
FeFiFoFum: Can reduce
tommygun: i think this way game is 1 point difference
FeFiFoFum: I think I want to win too badly lol
FeFiFoFum: But it's good learning
tommygun: \[object Object\]
tommygun: \[object Object\]
tommygun: black and white wins by .5 in each variation
FeFiFoFum: Hmmmm
tommygun: so my thinking for 9 by 9 after watching the pros play it
tommygun: is that if white gets to live in two corners then white wins
FeFiFoFum: That's true majority of the time, but white can be reduced too
FeFiFoFum: But yes.
tommygun: so that's why I left G7 atari alone and such, to get sente to make G3 live
FeFiFoFum: 2 or one half is enough
tommygun: but you attacked G3 anyway LOL
FeFiFoFum: Black is naturally the aggeessor
tommygun: weird since white is usually more aggressive in 19 by 19
tommygun: or rather white has to invade usually
FeFiFoFum: That is wierd lol
FeFiFoFum: Hmmm last one?
FeFiFoFum: For tonight
FeFiFoFum: I owe you now
FeFiFoFum: The rivalry is back!!!!
tommygun: ok
