C[smurph: oki
froofy: gg x2
smurph: gg ^^
smurph: salvaged
smurph: but it isn't as bad as i thought
smurph: on 9x9
froofy: I see you sometimes play good moves for your group to make it harder to threaten.
smurph: i still wouldn't recommend playing it on 19x19
smurph: want to review?
froofy: Yeah, it gets much easier.
smurph: because i don't know which you mean
froofy: The first game bottom right looked strong.
smurph: ah
smurph: \[object Object\]
froofy: I don't play so much like that, so he puts some stones inside and I spend all my time defending and shrinking my territory.
smurph: you mean moves like g3?
froofy: f2 in previous game.
smurph: hm don't quite remember how that went
smurph: but i think
smurph: something like this
smurph: \[object Object\]
smurph: well
froofy: yes.
smurph: it's a play on the standard joseki... mmmh
smurph: \[object Object\]
smurph: or rather
froofy: Okay.  It defends more to the right more than the empty triangle, if if you have to fill to make it later.
smurph: \[object Object\]
smurph: more like this
smurph: well, it makes eyeshape for one
smurph: which is nice
froofy: Yes.
froofy: I'll have to think about doing something like that more.
smurph: also has a nice followup move in the corner
smurph: \[object Object\]
smurph: which is quite big
smurph: on 9x9 it's all about efficiency
froofy: All moves from there, like e4, look good for that group
smurph: yea it's pretty much alive to a  point where i 100% focus on the rest of the board
smurph: usually you want to play things that are safe even if your opponent plays a move
smurph: of course that's easier said than done
froofy: I seem to be able to be pushed around pretty easily.
smurph: well, most ddk just reply to every move made
froofy: Maybe I play too conservatively, but yet not safely enough.
smurph: dan players are looking to abandon the local shapes asap
froofy: Why?
smurph: well, as long as you have a group that can 1) live 2) jump out 3) connect to another group 4) be sacrificed you don't want to hang around in one corner
smurph: since Go is about the empty space
froofy: Ah, so by abandon, you don't mean die.
smurph: not about the areas where stones are
smurph: unless intended
smurph: figuring out if stones are relevant to you is one step
smurph: g7 for example isn't doing much but providing aji
smurph: i don't have to save it, i'm prepared to give it up
smurph: but currently h4 looks juiciy
smurph: moves like f7 are usually bad since they take away your own liberties of stones that pertain to the livelihood of your group
froofy: I would think c7 instead of c3 for white, was his variation more accurate?
smurph: in a sense, if you try to save every stone, you create more liabilities than you can handle
smurph: c7 is safer than c3
smurph: but loses points
froofy: But not as many as dying.
smurph: w still isn't alive after c7
froofy: Just as easy to kill?
smurph: no, it would live
smurph: but not sure if it can live in sente
smurph: because next step, b will try to kill g3
smurph: since D8 attacks both groups at that point, b can follow up with h4
smurph: \[object Object\]
smurph: in other words, w c7 makes b d8 sente
smurph: and then bottom dies
smurph: probably
smurph: if w doesn't defend d8 top left, left might die
smurph: it's what makes tengen so good for b on 9x9
smurph: most of the time w will have to make life with 2 groups
froofy: Fuego doesn't repond to d8
smurph: probably plays h5 or something then?
froofy: Of course he let his group die before, maybe he does again.
smurph: :)
froofy: h6
smurph: ye similar
smurph: well, i'll leave it to you as practice to kill w's left side after w tenuki after d8
froofy: Man that's tough at higher levels.
smurph: you don't say
smurph: my record against minusgo is something like 1-20
froofy: So you beat him once?
smurph: yea
smurph: when it was 7d or something
froofy: I see someone playing mirror go and getting it every once in a while.
smurph: was also a 20-move tsumego sequence or something
froofy: Maybe it's learned it by now.
smurph: https://online-go.com/game/11587209
froofy: I guess he should have given up that stone to live.
froofy: But then he loses on points still.
smurph: :)
froofy: So no way out.
smurph: yea game was over after move 5-6 or so
smurph: as soon as i got to play b5 or b6 what it was, i was sure i'd win
smurph: but yea, ... 1-21 :P
smurph: way to go
froofy: Well, you'll get better too, just like he will.
froofy: He might just play more.
smurph: just way more slowly
smurph: myea
smurph: the effort it takes just to get from 3-4 and from 4-5 dan is excruciating
smurph: lose one game, you have to win 3 to make up for it
froofy: It's sad to think that the Google chess program started from nothing, just the basic rules, and in 4 hours of pretty heavy duty processing, managed to be able to overcome 1500 years of accumulated human knowledge.
smurph: well at least for Go it was 1700 computer years
froofy: If you play same level people, you don't have to win more than lose, do you?
smurph: just that google has all the resources to make that only last a few hours/ days
smurph: it takes forever to find 3d games though
smurph: there's like a handful of them online during the day
froofy: Right, but it  just sounds better to use the "4 hours", even though it's many, many processors.
froofy: :)
smurph: ofc
smurph: I just want to see AlphaGo the client for pc
froofy: You ever played the Japanese woman at 9d, not sure what her name is.
smurph: but they're probably afraid someone will disassemble it and steal their shit
smurph: Japanese 9d?
froofy: She's from Japan, but the name isn't English, so I don't know what it is.
froofy: I can recognize it when I see it.
smurph: You don't mean Haylee the Korean retired 3p, I assume
froofy: No.
smurph: I don't know of any strong Japanese players on Western servers actually
froofy: She's still amateur.
smurph: ever since habanero/rapyuta/daien left KGS
froofy: so you have to play xhu98 or letitgoo or krznb or however their names are spelled.
smurph: The only female Go player who's been making a name for herself lately is Ueno Asami, stomping Xie Yimin... but she's pro obviously.
smurph: well, if you remember the name, clue me in :)
froofy: I will, she's quite nice even to low levels like me.
smurph: i'm not sure if i have ever heard of any JPN amateur, much less a female one
smurph: then again i've also never been to tournaments
froofy: I see her every once in a while, I'll try to copy the name or something.
smurph: okie
smurph: I think OGS should steal KGS' "fan" feature
smurph: along with simul and rengo
froofy: I've never been on other servers.
froofy: But rengo seems fun.
smurph: ah, you missed so much drama and excitement
smurph: I joined KGS in 2005
smurph: even won 1 tourney there :)
froofy: Very good!
smurph: recently found out the acc i was using that time is still in existence
froofy: I've seen video of other servers, and I know nothing about playing on them, but graphically, OGS looks the best to me.
smurph: yea, but honestly i like KGS' review system much more
froofy: So you go back there some now?
smurph: oh since i can only access it via shinKGS the web interface, it's not quite the same experience
smurph: haven't played on there for years
smurph: but it's nice to switch servers every now and then
smurph: you can tell that server populations have their own distinct playstyle
froofy: So you should play on different ones to broaden your style also?
smurph: i think for faster games (i.e. not correspondence), IGS has the most consistent solid players
smurph: i think so
smurph: recently created an IGS acc as well to get back in the game
smurph: people on OGS are just bad at endgame
smurph: me included :)
froofy: What would make people on one server like that?
smurph: just feels that my mistakes are punished harder on that server
smurph: mostly time settings
smurph: i can't stand correspondence, so sadly i rarely think my endgame through
smurph: that's why most of my games are super aggressive
smurph: get a big lead, kill a group, don't worry about endgame
froofy: Hey, whatever works.
smurph: but against skilled defensive players, that doesn't work
smurph: and apparently skilled defense requires 4d :)
froofy: At least.
smurph: but yea, OGS is plenty strong
smurph: just few and far between
smurph: KGS is worse
froofy: kgs for strong players?
smurph: just has to do with server population
smurph: yea
froofy: what is the korean one?
smurph: Tygem
smurph: On Tygem you have to get to about 8d to play decent players
smurph: it's very generous
froofy: So 3d ogs = 8d tygem?
smurph: oh no
smurph: it depends
smurph: Last time I checked I was about 1d OGS and on my way to 5d Tygem
smurph: but that was years ago so I don't know how it is now
froofy: I have the impression that Korean players are keen to pick fights.
smurph: and i can't play on there because Linux without wine
smurph: yea, in general KR/CN players will play aggressively
smurph: they also don't ever resign
smurph: they will keep trying to do stuff
smurph: for 200 moves
smurph: tests your patience :)
froofy: I guess sometimes it works, but if you have to wear the other person down or trick them . . . do you really feel like you should have won?
froofy: If I win by luck, I like it, but it doesn't make me think I'm better than I am.
froofy: Because the next game I lose to 18k.
smurph: well, the only bad luck one can have is connection problems
smurph: or something along those lines
smurph: mistakes are mistakes
smurph: most of the time you don't win because of ingenious moves you made but simply because you made fewer mistakes than your opponent did
froofy: I generally lose by making mistakes or by simply not knowing where to play for the best result.
smurph: it's something related to your go-vision that will slowly develop
smurph: as you will encounter several shapes and corner structures many many times, you get an idea of how it will look if you play elsewhere and your opponent moves in.. whether that's still good for you etc
smurph: but it's mostly feeling, not hard science so to speak
smurph: one of the more disappointing things about improving is that you realize it's not that different after all. you still feel weak :D
froofy: Usually I don't get that far -- I know I have to invade, but can't think of the next move that will allow me to live.  But if I don't invade I lose.  So I should have invaded earlier.  But then my previous group dies . . . etc. 
smurph: if you can dig up some lessons by Shygost on Youtube, i think that would help you then.
smurph: he taught on KGS for a long time
froofy: Is it pertinent to 9x9?
smurph: 19x19
smurph: but most things transfer
smurph: you don't like 19x19?
froofy: I do, but I like quick better.
smurph: blitz? :)
froofy: I can spare 5 minutes at a time easier than 45 minutes at a time.
froofy: That too.
smurph: i've mostly played blitz throughout my Go career
smurph: games usually take 20min that's right
froofy: It feels worse to lose on something stupid after, say, 20 minutes, than 2 minutes.
smurph: true that
froofy: If I have time, though, no problem.
smurph: but you can remedy that by playing obscenely stronger opponents
froofy: Like yourself, for example?
smurph: at least i don't feel bad at all losing to Leela :P
smurph: well if you'd like to play, just hit me up, 9x9 19x19 i don't care
smurph: only 13x13 i hate with a passion
froofy: I do.  Got 7 stones and lost a group I kept trying to save and so lost.
smurph: that's to be expected
froofy: If I just ignored it, probably would have won, but gave up a lot more.
froofy: Too much hoping and not enough doing.
smurph: the more games you lose to strong players, the fewer games you'll lose to weaker players ^^
froofy: Well, thank you for your time and help.
smurph: thanks for the chat, mate
froofy: I'll challenge you later, whenever you're up for losing to a ddk.
smurph: oh yes
froofy: How humiliating it will be.
smurph: little do you know
smurph: i lose occasionally
froofy: Not to my level.
froofy: Maybe to 1k.
smurph: i think i've lost to 7k before on 9x9
froofy: What country are you from?
smurph: 1/100 games or so
smurph: mmh I'd tell you that after i know you better :)
smurph: not that it's relevant
froofy: Your syntax is British English, it seems.
smurph: It's more relaxed than it used to be.
froofy: Anyway, if from Great Britain, do you know of Fiddes Hard Wax Oil?
smurph: I have never heard of that
froofy: Just curious, it's  a coating for wood floors.
smurph: I figured something like that
smurph: do you treat your goban with it?
froofy: No, but trying to see if we want to use it on our floors, and looking for people that have it.
smurph: good luck on that endeavour!
froofy: Thank you.
froofy: See you later.
smurph: see you around
