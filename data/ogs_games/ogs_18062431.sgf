C[greenplayingblack: ko again?

greenplayingblack: ah I cant

C[scaredycat: Right, it's not a good example.
scaredycat: So now this is similar to last game in the corner, but you have me if I don't connect.

C[scaredycat: Can I live in lower left
scaredycat: ?
greenplayingblack: yes
greenplayingblack: or
greenplayingblack: hmm
greenplayingblack: maybe not
greenplayingblack: if I play b1
scaredycat: Yes, now.
scaredycat: IF you had played b1, no.
greenplayingblack: ah..
greenplayingblack: well, I almost learned it :S
scaredycat: Remember the seki move?  That's also the easiest way to get an eye in the corner, so if I go a2, you need to get the other point so I don't get the 1-1 eye.

C[scaredycat: So now the ko is important.

(;B[dc]
C[scaredycat: But you didn't fall for it.
scaredycat: Sometimes it's best.
greenplayingblack: )
scaredycat: Skip the ko so you don't lose something else.
scaredycat: Otherwise . . .
greenplayingblack: yeah, that was the feeling
scaredycat: So sorry, there isn't a good ko situation to show you.  I need to try to kill you in a corner.

C[scaredycat: Remember?  Always try the 2-2 point, even if it goes nowhere.
scaredycat: Ah, I did it one move too soon.l

scaredycat: But if I wait maybe you play it.

C[greenplayingblack: cant undo..
scaredycat: What else can you do here?

(;B[bh]
C[scaredycat: undo
scaredycat: Let's say you want to make sure my lower left stays dead.
greenplayingblack: ohhhh
scaredycat: Now you see the power of the ko.

(;W[ed]
(;B[af]
C[scaredycat: So, lets undo now.
scaredycat: Either I live on the lower left or I make seki on the right.
greenplayingblack: yeah, I think so...getting it I think...a little hard to get your head around
scaredycat: It just gives you a free move.
scaredycat: If you wanted to save the lower right, I get a free move to save my lower left.
greenplayingblack: right right, I think I see it
scaredycat: If you want to keep me dead on the lower left, then I have power over the right to make it a seki.
]
(;W[fd]
C[greenplayingblack: in this case its more then seki, right - its death
]
(;B[db]
C[scaredycat: Nope, seki.
scaredycat: But only because of j6.
scaredycat: Otherwise, death.

(;W[hd]
C[greenplayingblack: really, cant you kill lower right after h3 
scaredycat: Not if you play j2
greenplayingblack: but then you take it...and?
scaredycat: And then nothing.
scaredycat: Try.

(;B[ih]
(;W[ii]
C[greenplayingblack: ahh, yesus... right 
greenplayingblack: really seki
scaredycat: Yes.

C[greenplayingblack: theres nothing I can do about upper right, right?
scaredycat: Correct.
greenplayingblack: okay
scaredycat: Actually . . .
scaredycat: h8, we'll do another ko.
]
(;W[hh]
C[scaredycat: Then j9 after that.
greenplayingblack: but...is that a true ko..
greenplayingblack: oh
greenplayingblack: but its just a kill right
scaredycat: I guess.
]
(;B[hi]
C[scaredycat: Yeah, can't ever get enough liberties to kill.
scaredycat: Anyway, there are kos, and ko threats.
scaredycat: You use a ko threat to keep the other person from filling the ko.
scaredycat: So then you can retake it after.
greenplayingblack: Right I see that..you create a bigger threat somewhere else
scaredycat: Yes.
scaredycat: Until somebody can't find one, then somebody wins the ko.
scaredycat: I have an old example.
greenplayingblack: I've seen that in 19x19 games in pro tournaments...where they can really do some damage
greenplayingblack: oh, nic
greenplayingblack: *nice
scaredycat: I was playing 9x9 against seom russian.
scaredycat: some.
greenplayingblack: okay
scaredycat: And I had a group in the lower left and was ready to go to the upper right.
scaredycat: But he made a ko in my lower left group that I needed to win or the group was dead.
scaredycat: It was toward the beginning of the game, so he didn't have much territory, just some stones around.  I had the territory.
scaredycat: However, if I lose my group, I obviously would lose.
greenplayingblack: (listening)
scaredycat: But he had no group to threaten, I could just cut some stones.
scaredycat: But he doesn't care, because he know if he kills, he wins.  And I know if he kills he wins.
scaredycat: So I cannot threaten him enough to keep him from killing me.
scaredycat: So I have to win the ko, and in doing so (like I told you) I give him a free move.
scaredycat: Once I win the ko, he can move wherever he wants.
scaredycat: But I live.
scaredycat: But my group is so small and with his free move, he makes a large enough group to win anyway.
scaredycat: So I was guaranteed to lose as soon as he made the ko.  If I prevented it, probably I still lose, but then I don't give him a free move by him making me capture the ko.
scaredycat: So at least it may have been more respectable.
scaredycat: So most of the time kos at the lower level are just about taking a stone back and forth.
scaredycat: Not much to them, fighting over 1 point at the end of the game.
greenplayingblack: yeah, thats my experience so far, but I did start to see the usefulness in threatening something else, but not to this degree.
scaredycat: How you want to use them is to start when you're invading a group (if you can't kill outright).
scaredycat: Start a ko in the group, and you'll almost be guaranteed to get a good move elsewhere.
scaredycat: Because the other person doesn't want to lose his whole group, so that's probably the biggest issue on the board.
greenplayingblack: Yeah, playing inside a group that cant be killed for a ko and move is powerfull, its a new thing to me
scaredycat: And he'll eventually capture your ko stones, and then you . . . well.
scaredycat: Think of it this way.
scaredycat: Your previous move was a threat to get him to not take the ko again, so it was probably a pretty good move anyway.
greenplayingblack: so, you get sente at the hand of a ko
scaredycat: Not only that, think of it as 2 moves in a row.l
greenplayingblack: \[object Object\]
scaredycat: That make it more powerful.
