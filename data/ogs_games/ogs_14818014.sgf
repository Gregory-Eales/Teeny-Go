C[SlimeSloth: Cheap luck
SlimeSloth: Not gonna play with you in the future
SlimeSloth: Thats for sure
RaiOni: cheap luck?
SlimeSloth: Demanded request several times
SlimeSloth: After one sec
SlimeSloth: You owe your opponent to accept
SlimeSloth: At least some of them
SlimeSloth: You accepted none
SlimeSloth: That is where cheap luck comes from
RaiOni: You had 30 sec per move and made a bad decision. The move was not by mistake
SlimeSloth: It does not matter how much time i havr
RaiOni: If someone clicks by mistake an obviously misclicked move, of course I let him retake the move.
SlimeSloth: What matters is the all the requests i demanded
RaiOni: Do you know how often I made a bad move, which I regreted directly after I made it 
SlimeSloth: You think the button is there for misclicks only?
RaiOni: Yes
SlimeSloth: You would be fooling urself
SlimeSloth: It is not
RaiOni: What other reasons could you have?
RaiOni: Of course one makes mistakes in a short-time game. This still doesn't mean you can just retake every second move you made
RaiOni: And then blame the loss on it.
SlimeSloth: Fast decisions, indecision, and carelessness
SlimeSloth: A game is not about winning the game
SlimeSloth: It is about us leaving this game better than we entered
SlimeSloth: That is what a game is
SlimeSloth: To entertain us
SlimeSloth: Not to make us spite our opponents for not giving them a chance
RaiOni: When you only have 10sec left to make the move a fast decision is all that matters, indecision is a bad thing which is your own problem and which is a thing you have to overcome to play go, the same goes for carelessness
RaiOni: Yes, the game is not about winning
SlimeSloth: I am done talking
