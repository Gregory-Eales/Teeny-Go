C[NominRamen: I'll go ahead and resign this one since your timer is running low. You got me beat - good work! You handled these corner attacks very well. The only correction I have really is that a few times you used a move to kill stones which were going to die eventually anyway. These moves are equivalent to passing and can give your opponent a strong boost. In this case though it still was not enough for W to catch up. Every W stone on the board is dead :)
