C[Amazing: didn´t see that coming.
rubberducky: I am undefeated in terms of skill and outsmarting 
rubberducky: I have lost before
Amazing: well, you´re like 8 k above me ...
rubberducky: but always due to misclicks afk timeouts hacks or UNFAIR handicaps 
Amazing: ^^
rubberducky: true
rubberducky: I started 15k here
Amazing: not always
Amazing: this time you just got me.
Amazing: again?
rubberducky: well undefeated at this point 
Amazing: 4losses?
rubberducky: yep
Amazing: you profile tells me you got 4 losses :D
rubberducky:  I am undefeated in terms of skill and outsmarting
Amazing: so what about those 4 people?
rubberducky: one of the game timed out BEFORE 10 seconds
rubberducky: 2 games were handicaps games where admin MODIFIED my rank without me knowing 
Amazing: And you think 10 seconds is an appropriate time to make yout turn?
rubberducky: so it was rigged
rubberducky: and 1 game I misclicked
Amazing: Did you read your 3 message?
Amazing: third
Amazing: I just think it´s kinda ironic.
rubberducky: I clicked somewhere I did not intend to, I knew where I wanted to click before clicking so its not a  mistake where you see something later
Amazing: Well, thanks for the game. See you ;)
