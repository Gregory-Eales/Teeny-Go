C[Raffles: well played :-)
LittleOstrich: that was interesting
LittleOstrich: ty
LittleOstrich: dunno
Raffles: you crept up on my main group
Raffles: it was the edge group I was worried about
Raffles: should have been more careful
LittleOstrich: my groups were all pretty weak
LittleOstrich: and there was 1 move
LittleOstrich: that could have killed me for sure
LittleOstrich: all the time
LittleOstrich: C2 was neccessary
Raffles: go ahead show me
Raffles: ah ok
Raffles: yes that was a good move when you played it
Raffles: but I had to protect my stones on the edge
LittleOstrich: give them up and get the big group :P
Raffles: if you capture the stones on the edge, I don't get the big group
Raffles: at least that's how it looked to me
Raffles: I think I should have let you live
LittleOstrich: can u review ?
