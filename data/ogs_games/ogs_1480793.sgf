C[yunyiplay: thx
Budfox: ok
yunyiplay: 45 was terrible
yunyiplay: it should be h5, instead of j5. i was out of my mind
yunyiplay: a simple mistake by nervousness. 
yunyiplay: i should won that part if i do h5.
yunyiplay: which is a simple common sense move. 
yunyiplay: it was a definite win
yunyiplay: after h5 white stones there are dead
yunyiplay: no questino
yunyiplay: there's no play on f1
yunyiplay: simply g1
yunyiplay: after g1, e3, f2, 
yunyiplay: d2, j2, e1, d1, c1, j4
yunyiplay: white can't live there. 
yunyiplay: d2,
yunyiplay: h1 was fatal, because it reduces white's "breath" from 4 to 3. i somehow thought if i go there my up right corner stones would be jeapadised. but i was wrong. they are safe.
yunyiplay: bye
Muglug: awesome to watch guys
Muglug: you couldve won that group or not?
Muglug: i am thinking of a way white could make a living there
Muglug: maybe with F1 or something
Muglug: after H5
Muglug: yes
Muglug: but what if he goes F1
Muglug: after your H5 move
Muglug: he threatens your groups bottom
Muglug: if you dont respond
Muglug: \[object Object\]
Muglug: \[object Object\]
Muglug: at first i thought black would defend at E1
Muglug: but that would mean death
Muglug: nice game though
Muglug: im out
Muglug: wouldve never played h1
Muglug: it seems so risky for f3 and g2
Muglug: but it wouldve worked out
