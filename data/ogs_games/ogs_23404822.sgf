C[bajidu: no chance T.T
bajidu: where did I go wrong?
basvet81: looks like getting split was not ok
bajidu: but where is my territory
bajidu: if I connect
bajidu: G7 and g3 feel like miai
bajidu: for w
bajidu: T.T
bajidu: well, thanks anyway
basvet81: that's the idea, but it is stil not easy to live on either side, and black can probably squeeze white until it is tiny and in the process make it;s own points
bajidu: ah I see
bajidu: thanks!
basvet81: also, i have to first live with one side, giving a lot of strength to black which it can use on the other side
basvet81: ok np
