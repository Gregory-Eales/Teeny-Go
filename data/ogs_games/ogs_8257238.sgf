C[Aitrus72: nice game!
dmadness: I think they say that the Danish
dmadness: are the happiest people on the planet
Aitrus72: it is a very cool place.  I'm actually from the US (california) but living in copenhagen for 3 years
Aitrus72: wasn't sure which one to put :)
dmadness: where in Calif
dmadness: I live in San Jose
dmadness: how many time Fioli garden for you?
Aitrus72: yeah, it's easy to believe.  though I read that norway has passed denmark this year in the happiness rankings ;)  I am from Livermore (east bay area)
dmadness: small world
Aitrus72: yeah seriously!
Aitrus72: I actually haven't been to Tivoli yet!  need to go
dmadness: it's pretty good ...
dmadness: are you in tech?
Aitrus72: math (at the university, for now).  you?
Aitrus72: thinking about maybe making a change to tech tho
dmadness: tech ...
dmadness: big controversy in the USA here saying we are taught too much math
dmadness: I think they are right
Aitrus72: really?  too much?  I would agree easily if you said the wrong math
Aitrus72: personally I think things like linear algebra and probability are way more important to know in a modern tech world than calculus and geometry
dmadness: huh ... maybe so
Aitrus72: what do they mean by too much?
dmadness: ok ... take your average working Joe ... how much math do they need?
dmadness: more to the point ... do they need Algebra?
Aitrus72: well, I suppose it depends a bit where they work.  But the concept is that knowing more math changes the way you look at problems
dmadness: seriously ...
Aitrus72: yeah I think way more linear algebra, way less algebra would be a good trade
dmadness: does the guy working at the DMV need algebra?
dmadness: does the plumber need algebra?
Aitrus72: well that's way on one end of the "what you need" spectrum, for sure.  But in any case, (s)he certainly doesn't need to know how to solve giant equations with logarithms and trig functions.  I think maybe a little statistics knowledge might not hurt at the dmv though.  And if there's data entry/processing/visualization involved with the dmv job, then a tiny bit of matrix knowledge would be good too
dmadness: ok ... fair enough
Aitrus72: plumbing, well.... in the US we have a problem with plumbers
dmadness: I'm an engineer ... 52 years old
dmadness: BSEE
Aitrus72: because no one goes to school to become a plumber.  they only do it if they fail at everything else :P
dmadness: if I took Linear algebra I'd have a minor in math
Aitrus72: which is.... not a good way to train quality plumbers
Aitrus72: cool :)
dmadness: so ... question ... when was the last time I did a Calculus problem at my work?
Aitrus72: solftware?
dmadness: yes 
Aitrus72: I don't know, but I guess never is a distinct possibilty.  I think the emphasis on calculus in school is waaaaay outdated
dmadness: yes ... never
Aitrus72: because nowadays we do everything discretized/linearized and totally avoid continuous models when possible
dmadness: true ...
dmadness: don't get me wrong ... I LIKE math .. I think it's easy
dmadness: I'm just saying ... way too much wasted time in school with it
Aitrus72: when was the last time you did a matrix operation 
Aitrus72: yeah.  it sure ain't efficient
Aitrus72: i'm just now trying to learn some machine learning basics.  Fun!
dmadness: cool
dmadness: what sent you to Copenhagen?
Aitrus72: a 3-year postdoc job
Aitrus72: and, well, it's a cool place to be for a bit!  I'll be very sad to leave
dmadness: nice ... glad you went?
Aitrus72: ya
dmadness: pretty girls over there huh?
Aitrus72: haha ya, but it's impossible to make friends with Danes.  I know more Swedish and Norwegian people
dmadness: huh ... they stick to themselves eh?
Aitrus72: yep.  I suppose it doesn't help that I'm in a math department all the time, which is almost entirely foreigners
dmadness: huh
Aitrus72: anyway, gotta run now, but my email/hangouts is aitrus72@gmail in case you want to play again some time!  :)
dmadness: you got it!  cheers
Aitrus72: cheers
