C[ReadyToGo!: G3 was scary
froofy: Not really, it was just a hail mary.
froofy: gg
ReadyToGo!: gg
froofy: I want e2, but I can't play it.
ReadyToGo!: yea too little breathing space in the corner
ReadyToGo!: If you want we can attempt a bigger board
froofy: Fuego thinks e8 for move 8, looks better for sure.
froofy: Anything okay, whatever you want.
ReadyToGo!: I don't know about e8, it seems to be immediately in danger
froofy: \[object Object\]
ReadyToGo!: oh you mean earlier
ReadyToGo!: yes this seems very dangerous
froofy: But of course I don't see it.
ReadyToGo!: I am not quite sure how to defend against E8 in general
ReadyToGo!: tbh
ReadyToGo!: I have had the situation that people attack at E8 directly and it more often than not ended not too good
froofy: Maybe there is no good defense, Fuego's continuation is similar to what I show, so definitely lives.
froofy: Put your games into a program afterwards and see how the computer responds to a puzzling move, then you play the color your opponent's color if it still isn't clear . . . to see if you can win with that position.
froofy: Because sometimes you can't understand why the computer responded the way it did . . . until you try to finish the game against it, then it quickly becomes apparent.
ReadyToGo!: ^^
ReadyToGo!: it's same thing against strong human oponents
