C[LovroS: i'd prefere C5, more flexible and nicer shape. maybe just taste =)
sucram: was concerned that i'd played 3 stones and didn't really have any 'territory' - though c5 would leave that a1 corner too open?
LovroS: jea... but still its difficult to invade
bC5 - C3
B4 - E2
F2 - B3
D2 .... hard to bring smth living in there.
LovroS: jea. i don't like to start hoshi. so donno.

C[LovroS: this stone is not really important. Better E7
