C[alexn_new: Yep, sorry
kakangel: H4 is correct move, nice one. B is not able to cut

C[alexn_new: In this variation B cuts and loses by 2.5 points. Doesn't seem B can get better result, does it?
kakangel: yes, b cut and loses, maybe there is better way but i don't see

(;W[ae]
C[kakangel: c8 to ask sente, interesting, but i need sente too) So i will not capture two stones)

(;B[di]
C[alexn_new: If B have protected two stones by D7, he gets carpenters square config, which is seki 
]
(;W[ci]
C[kakangel: w aniway need A5 move even if b D7, because B3 attach is really painfull aji for me, so no seki or ko just gote life

(;B[ei]
C[alexn_new: B3 attachment doesn't give B extra eye

(;W[dc]
C[kakangel: it gives big amount of threats
kakangel: \[object Object\]
kakangel: playeble for w but complicated
kakangel: \[object Object\]
kakangel: carpenters square does not have b5 stone? w cant play A8 B8, this is not connect threat, because b has e9 in sente to cut
alexn_new: I've considered that shape: http://www.go4go.net/go/carpenter_square_11
alexn_new: Indeed the G8 weakness makes difference

C[kakangel: Unfortunelly after C8, you make another shape that has to be finished in this example i did L shape un upper left is dead. But take a look another L shape with extenions in lower right, its big differense, this is alive shape but if w plays A or C, b has to play B to make 2 eyes, and if W plays A and C black need to play both B and D moves. In game happened same situation, but you ignore one move... This is quite dangerous.

kakangel: We review the game before it ends. I hope this does not obstruct you from playing...
kakangel: but in this game B is not dead so easy, there is ajies that b can help make this group alive...
