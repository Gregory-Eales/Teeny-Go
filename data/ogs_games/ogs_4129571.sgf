C[Vivant Eclipse: true, that is why we pass
Vivant Eclipse: if nobody wants to go there, the group that is surrounded is dead
Vivant Eclipse: because otherwise itd be like saying a dog defended against a lion
zerodan: it is not surrounded, it has two liberties
zerodan: study rules please
Vivant Eclipse: i understand that it has two liberties. i didnt mean actually "surrounded" i meant enclosed in the top rigght of the board
zerodan: Rules are the final way to judge. If you do not accept the result, I contact somebody responsible for the tournament.
Vivant Eclipse: no problem man, i was just agreeing with the autoscore
Vivant Eclipse: \[object Object\]
zerodan: Ok, let us see, what the director of the tournament says.
zerodan: But it is good try to use your argument on the white group. It is surrounded, nobody wants to play there, it is dead :) Agree now?
gamesorry: It's seki, Vivant :)
gamesorry: Please refer to http://senseis.xmp.net/?Seki : "two live groups share liberties which neither of them can fill without dying")
