C[marucha: ha ha that was fun
gbinunewton: 0.5 komi?
gbinunewton: tch
marucha: correct
gbinunewton: that's extremely unfair
marucha: what?
marucha: you want to win because of komi?
gbinunewton: white needs a komi of at least 5.5, if not more
gbinunewton: Becuase black has a huuuge opening advantage
marucha: where did u get that?
gbinunewton: Why do you think komi exists?
marucha: what do you know about 9x9?
gbinunewton: 9x9 has been computationally solved. Best opening is tengen for black, and black always wins
gbinunewton: in a perfect game
gbinunewton: So, white needs komi to counter the advantage
marucha: by what score?
marucha: hm?
gbinunewton: That is still debated. 
gbinunewton: Usually by the amount of the komi
marucha: which is what?
gbinunewton: 5.5 - 7.5, according to most pros. 
gbinunewton: Some want even higher
marucha: oh now you talk about pros?
marucha: and before about computer?
gbinunewton: Yes why not?
marucha: play symmetric game then you will see
gbinunewton: Exactly. in a symmetric game, white would always lose.
marucha: tendon avoids symmetry so it is different
marucha: i do not play tendon so komi is .5
marucha: tengen
gbinunewton: https://forums.online-go.com/t/81-little-lions-an-introduction-to-the-9x9-board-for-advanced-beginners/3138
marucha: on 9x9 margin of winning is lecithin 5.5
gbinunewton: Read that up. It will give you a better idea
marucha: you can read yourself
marucha: i already know
marucha: you send me back to school?
gbinunewton: If you did, you would already know that the winning margin is much more that 5.5, and that only one white group (at most) would survive in a perfect game.
gbinunewton: Stop being such a haughty know it all, moron.
marucha: oh now you call my names?
gbinunewton: didn't realise that was your name
gbinunewton: Describes you quite correctly
marucha: very interesting behaviour
marucha: go on
marucha: may be you know some more interesting terms
marucha: mr newton
gbinunewton: Duh. Piss off. Go die in a hole
