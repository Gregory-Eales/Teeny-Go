C[RookE7: thank you
Real Clock: i liked the D6 move gives a lot of options 
Real Clock: although it was my move, so it probably is impolite to say that I liked it.. :)
RookE7: I don't think it's impolite here
Real Clock: well maybe not impolite, but it sound like bragging .)
RookE7: I don't have enough competence to say if it is a good move
Real Clock: \[object Object\]
