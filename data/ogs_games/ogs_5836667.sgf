C[Enumaris: Thanks for the game, gg
spatula: you can give me whatever I want and still win lol
spatula: gg
Enumaris: Hmm
Enumaris: 9x9 is weird, I have no kibitz for it lol
spatula: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: I counted that the easy way wins so I didn't go for it
Enumaris: Or anything like fighting a ko
Enumaris: Seems risky
spatula: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: Yeah I also counted from there
spatula: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: So I didn't really read any if it at the end..
spatula: :(
spatula: man.. unfair.. I read so hard
Enumaris: D:
spatula: and you didn't punish my mistakes
Enumaris: H6 for f8 is big loss
spatula: huh?
Enumaris: It's gifting one point vs allowing me a stone on the outside
spatula: oh
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
spatula: not sure what I am thinking
spatula: .. I know you can kill
spatula: ... I was trying to sacrifice stone
spatula: lol
spatula: to get some sentes..
Enumaris: Yeah but the fact that I can kill by fixing outside is a big loss I think. If you can sacrifice by sealing me in while I'm forced to actually kill the two stones then it would be a good sacrifice
spatula: right
spatula: I don't know how to do that
spatula: that's the problem
Enumaris: Not sure you could for that cutting point
spatula: what do I do?
Enumaris: Smshr suggest you peep
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: But I can fight back against your two corners
Enumaris: I've no idea
Enumaris: 9x9 is hard lol
Enumaris: I just go by General principles
spatula: huh..
spatula: what is that
Enumaris: Take away the top right corner 
spatula: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: I don't really try to read out all the sequences when I play 9x9 I just sort of like to stay connected and thick
Enumaris: Possible
Enumaris: So many variations though
spatula: yea
spatula: I can't see g7
spatula: that's probably why I'm bad at go
Enumaris: Hmm
spatula: not even crossed my mind
Enumaris: You're not bad bro
Enumaris: Chatting here is a pain, let's go back to wechat
spatula: sure
