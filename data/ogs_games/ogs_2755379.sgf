C[Recursing: thank you very much
Sviazen: gg, thank you too, nice play ^ ^
Recursing: move 53 was very bad
Recursing: A2 seems vital
Sviazen: a1 was definitely very bad
Recursing: also A8, since I would need to play B9 before A9, and I would lose an eye
Sviazen: i want to try too much, without securing my stone
Sviazen: i still need to play fast, i'm used to play irl
Sviazen: thank you for your review ^ ^
Recursing: With A2 instead of A1 I think oyu would have won
Recursing: Have fun!
Sviazen: i was thinking that your top group was alive and i didn't see the treat i could do ^ ^'
