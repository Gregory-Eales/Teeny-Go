C[NominRamen: an interesting note with a move like g2 is it can feel passive. maybe it isn't now, but eventually that will feel like the obvious response, and even though it is strong, it can feel subservient like you are playing into w's hands
NominRamen: it can be worth it to consider this. sometimes playing a strange move is worthwhile instead of just following the lead pulling you
rpswanson3: Yeah, trying to take initiative back

C[NominRamen: yep. but you can't always have it. most often, the strong obvious response is still the right one

C[rpswanson3: Yeah this isn't going to turn around
NominRamen: yep yep, had it until the end again. also your last move killed the bottom right. w's next move is h2
NominRamen: b needed something like h3 to save the group instead of g9 which could be played at any time
