Angel of death: \[object Object\]
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: Nah black has more problems than white
Alderi: White is completely alive
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: Ah wait
Alderi: There's an atari
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: There
Alderi: Black can't save the lower left
Alderi: Then what
Alderi: Ah nice
Alderi: Let's see
Alderi: Yeah
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: Here white wins by 1 or 2 points in the end I think
Alderi: Well, in 9x9 the game is decided early on
Alderi: D5 was probably the losing move
Alderi: White E4 was probably the correct move
Alderi: Nah It's not too early I think
Alderi: We've seen the variations
Alderi: the E4 cut is too painful
Alderi: Then again
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: yeah it was a trick move, but what if white doesn't fall into the trap?
Alderi: Seems pretty grim for black yeah
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: Not sure it's enough to win though
Alderi: Then white has to live on the left
Alderi: Seems hard
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: This secures the cut too
Alderi: Hmm
Alderi: \[object Object\]
Alderi: This way white doesn't have the liberty problem
Alderi: That's what is fun in studying games ^^
Alderi: Yup he can
Alderi: For now we only change white moves because all we see after D5 are losses
Alderi: Which means D5 is probably the losing move
Alderi: Ok, a bit later though, I have to go into a meeting right now ^^
Alderi: yup ^^
Alderi: You're getting good, it's interesting to study games with you
Alderi: Well, if it makes you win, it's all good
Alderi: And studying positions is always good, it trains the board visualization
Alderi: White wasn't bad
Alderi: But as you said, the F2 F3 stones make a lot of bad aji
Alderi: White has to fix immediately with D4 and it's enough to win
Alderi: But D5 loses
Alderi: haha ^^
Alderi: I'll make it progress a bit morer until it beats you! XD
Alderi: Anyway, goota go for real :)
Alderi: See you later!
