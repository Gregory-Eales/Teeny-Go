C[Amazing: Well played. I´ll pass one last time. If you saw any obvious mistakes it would be great if you could write them in chat.
Amazing: You win by 3.5 if i defend B7.
Amazing: Well, at least 3.5 :-) Maybe more.
Amazing: Yeah, more like B+8.5 with captured stones.
Amazing: \[object Object\]
solomonko: Hi I appreciate your efforts in creating this tournament, and presenting variation on this game.
solomonko: Although I've been playing here at OGS for a long time, I'm not sure
solomonko: how to make variations and insert (link?) it into the chat.
solomonko: As for the variation you made, I think it is OK. My first impression was that
solomonko: the attachment of black 4 at B5 is usually Hane at A4 since it ends with black's sente.
solomonko: But as for this game since the remaining place was only at C9, the result was the same.
solomonko: As for the passing, if I pass the game will end, right? Since this game is a rated
solomonko: game I cannot pass here, please resign or continue to play to the end.
