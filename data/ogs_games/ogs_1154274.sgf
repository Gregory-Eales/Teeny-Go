C[Umuri: it was that corner again. whenever ya got 3 in a diagonal., debate reinforcing it
Umuri: esp if you have something nearby that can't afford to lose a liberty
Umuri: because then you can cascade that liberty loss up the chain, threatening each link next

C[Umuri: understand you don't need to kill that
Umuri: you just need to stop it from being alive
Umuri: there's a huge difference
Umuri: what you did was try to go for a kill. but if instead you went b-9, you would have stopped it from gaining its 2 needed eyes
Umuri: and even though it isn't killed, it'd still not be alive, and would die at endgame

C[goobering: I'm still bad at reading those. Read about it often enough, but with time constraints, etc...
Umuri: yeah
Umuri: part of it is just practice
