C[demosha: heh, as I'm far worse than you, think I'll use that analyze feature.
demosha: I won't stand a chance based on pure reading

C[demosha: of course, I have still little chance even with it. I probably don't use it properly nor wisely

C[demosha: but 6.5 points in a 9*9 against a stronger opponent is a pain up the a*se

C[bisade97: here's  a tip
demosha: if there was no komi, you would have won by 1 point
bisade97: next time, play in the centre of the board
demosha: but with komi it makes it 7.5
bisade97: best position to play for black
bisade97: black does have a big advantage
bisade97: as it plays first
demosha: Not that big on a 9*9 when players are about as good (and there you're clearly better)
demosha: And WHEN did the middle star become a good move to play first ?
bisade97: for a 9x9
demosha: It only works if you can spread from there
bisade97: it has always been the best move
bisade97: yes
bisade97: true
demosha: not sure about that
bisade97: ok
demosha: why didn't you make it then ^^ ? 
bisade97: for black
bisade97: not for white
demosha: lol
bisade97: you had a corner protected
bisade97: so i had to do the same
bisade97: corners and sides win the game
demosha: if you can shelter a corner from the middle it sure is a good move, but not only for black
bisade97: it would be pretty hard to do
bisade97: but if you know how to stop your opponent from making eyes
bisade97: then it's a good first opening move
demosha: for it to be good, you first need to be clearly superior to your opponent
bisade97: i disagree
demosha: My first games were on 9-by-9s against novices as bad as I was. As long as I hadn't become a lot better than 'em, it wasn't elping a lot to play tengen
demosha: helping*
bisade97: if you know how to come out with a move after a skirmish
bisade97: then you are more likely to win
bisade97: hmm, it's hard to explain
demosha: whatever, thanks for the game
bisade97: you too'
demosha: it was a pleasure to play you and to talk with you, I hope we will meet again someday
