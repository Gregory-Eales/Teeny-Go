C[monfrere: I think you have a bug
Tengen=canceled game's idiot !: I don't 
monfrere: Why do you keep resigning
Tengen=canceled game's idiot !: Because the first time we played
Tengen=canceled game's idiot !: You haven't had the time to say "hello" at the beginning of the game, even with the pre game timer 
Tengen=canceled game's idiot !: But after I resigned, you found the energy and the time to say "gg"
Tengen=canceled game's idiot !: I don't play people saying "gg" to a resigning opponent only with a victory assured first :-)
monfrere: some people say gg only at the end
