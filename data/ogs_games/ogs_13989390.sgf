C[fishku: this is getting pretty tactical
fishku: I wouldn't have found some of my moves without analyzing I think
fishku: as you're putting up more resistance, I also have to up my game :p
mft0: Yeah, but I really thought I would be able to kill at least part of your group on the bottom right
mft0: Maybe it will be good to disable the analyzing in the interest of not slowing down the game. I do notice that I take longer since I'm checking too many posibilities.

C[fishku: it's pretty hopeless for white, but I'm trying my best to confuse the situation
fishku: that's why we get lots of possibilities

C[mft0: Well, it is working. You pretty consistently do a move I didn't analyse.

C[fishku: I analyzed the game with a bot and found d3 and e1 as mistakes for my side :p

C[mft0: Well, white is alive there anyway right?
fishku: it's ko at best
fishku: ah but yes, lower right is alive
fishku: was talking about current situation
mft0: ok, I was already trying to find a way to kill : P
mft0: I think you can kill my group at F2 before I get anywhere

C[fishku: thanks for the game
fishku: and well done
mft0: thanks. it was interesting
fishku: if you win one more in a row, we should probably go to 2 stones handicap
mft0: yeah, but I bet I still won't win without analyse with 3 handicap
mft0: but 2 with analyse sounds good too
