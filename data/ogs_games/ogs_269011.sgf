C[KyuT: I've never been a fan of this move. I don't understand why it should be better than F6 F7 F5 as you get a similar sequence but Black's shape seems worse. But apparently pros play it so...

C[KyuT: I think this should C4. It seems like Black can win on normal endgame so White still has to try something and Black's shape is stronger with C4.

C[KyuT: No idea if this is correct. I feel like I need to play a move that can aim at both C3 (to make D5 a real move) and at living in the lower right by exploiting the F5 cut. Maybe C3 first is ok? (C3, C4, E2) I don't know

C[KyuT: I think you can also consider F3 here.

C[KyuT: I didn't expect this. It felt like it would be overplay with the cut on board (simply because I have a corner and you don't). I think the game is close, maybe good for Black if you just defend and I life in gote and you get to play first in the top left.

C[KyuT: I'm not sure if this helps you but it feels to me like it could cost you. It's always sente to play and you may want F4 later. It's also obviously pretty slow for me to play there. I think H8 first is probably better (haven't read it out though).

C[KyuT: I was expecting J5. I think White may win anyway but I'd only looked at a few sequences and wasn't feeling all that confident.
Kobajagi: I think you win in all sequences I could think of after J5, by one liberty (sacrificing the three stones at the bottom).
KyuT: I think so too. Just wasn't 100% sure there wasn't something sneaky. What did you think about not playing H2?
Kobajagi: I thought you were ahead by a few points if I played C6, so I was considering C7, which was almost good for me on points, but I am sure you would find some holes in my shape.
Kobajagi: It's a good point about not putting G5 in immediately, it just might gain me a liberty somehow...
KyuT: In general, outside liberties before inside liberties. Playing inside liberties first can only lose you liberties.
