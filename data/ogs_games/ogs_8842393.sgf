C[froofy: with a handicap I can lose easily -- unless I play more territorial.
froofy: Better players can see so much more stuff than I, that I get in all sorts of trouble.
shinuito: Yeah I think that's how you have to play with handicap
froofy: If I just play defensive and try not to take too much, I usually do better.
shinuito: like you need a foothold

froofy: Hey, I had enough anyway!
shinuito: Thanks for the help!
shinuito: yeah congrats!
froofy: Extend to f8 first, then you can block.
froofy: (e9)
froofy: But you still have to protect e9 also afterwards.
shinuito: Ah right
shinuito: just take allow a certain amount in and then cover
shinuito: I think there's things like that I miss not playing enough smaller games
froofy: Just one more stone is enough in this case.
