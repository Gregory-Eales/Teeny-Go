Pond Turtle: Single colour is hard
BHydden: this was fun
Pond Turtle: i got reckless
BHydden: i don't play unranked much haha
Pond Turtle: Well
Pond Turtle: I have exams and there are super hard for me
Pond Turtle: mentally
BHydden: yeah
Pond Turtle: I find I can't relax or derive pelasure from many things
Pond Turtle: I don't need to pile up "rank stress" on top of that
BHydden: i know what you mean
BHydden: haha 
BHydden: I'm new enough that I'm moving up ranks w/o too much stress ;)
Pond Turtle: anyway
Pond Turtle: I got a teacher recently
BHydden: i think I'm roughly 18k atm
Pond Turtle: but don't ahve time until these stupid damn exams are over
Pond Turtle: once they are
BHydden: nice one
Pond Turtle: I plan to spend 30 hours a week on go
Pond Turtle: until summer is over
BHydden: i kinda have an unofficial tutor here on ogs :P
Pond Turtle: I have been to few AFK tournaments even
BHydden: wow nice one
BHydden: jelly
Pond Turtle: do you get those in australia?
BHydden: closest IRL club is about 90 minute drive from me
Pond Turtle: that is aussie flag right?
BHydden: but yes i believe we have tournaments
BHydden: yes I'm aussie
Pond Turtle: do you have your own special rules like americans do
Pond Turtle: with their crazy aga stuff :-D
BHydden: no idea but probably not
BHydden: too much effort haha
BHydden: prob use jap or chn rules
BHydden: but haven't been to a club yet due to distance
BHydden: :'(
BHydden: so OGS is all I have for now
BHydden: thinking of making my own board so i can start playing my wife ;)
BHydden: and hopefully get some IRL friends into it
BHydden: but see how it all goes
Pond Turtle: I like homecraft people
Pond Turtle: I boough simple board and glass stones
Pond Turtle: and I have magnetic one for studying joseki on train and so on
BHydden: yeah I've looked into that but stones are so expensive haha
Pond Turtle: hmmm
Pond Turtle: I can get set of glass stones for 10-20 euro over here
Pond Turtle: even cheaper if you are willing to go plastic
Pond Turtle: Which I ABSOLUTELY am not
Pond Turtle: hahahaha
BHydden: i think cheap glass stones here start at 60AUD plus postage
Pond Turtle: Though in my club we get these plastic stones with metal piece inside for extra weight and they dont feel half bad
BHydden: but probably a supply and demand thing... it's really hard to find go distributers that ship to aus
Pond Turtle: true
Pond Turtle: *I assume so I mean
BHydden: too small of a niche
BHydden: we don't have that many japanese / korean people here
BHydden: and for some reason chinese australians prefer chess over go
Pond Turtle: same here
Pond Turtle: czech republic is pretty monoethnical
BHydden: we have a lot of chinese people here haha
BHydden: just apparently not many of them play go :(
Pond Turtle: white folks 90+% over here basically
Pond Turtle: some gypsies and vietnamese
Pond Turtle: and that about it
Pond Turtle: and vietnamese are on the whole either studying super hard universities or running convinience stores
Pond Turtle: Or weed growing rigs respectively
Pond Turtle: so no Go
BHydden: is go that big in vietnam anyway?
Pond Turtle: no idea
Pond Turtle: anyway
BHydden: lol
Pond Turtle: I am off :-)
