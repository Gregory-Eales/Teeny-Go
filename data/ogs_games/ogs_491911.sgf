C[robertdg: Thanks for the game
ba-yu: \[object Object\]
ba-yu: Your move 15 feels like an overplay
ba-yu: Your move 21 d5: is an absolute nogo in my view.
ba-yu: d3 and d4 are not splitting white. So, there is no reason to save these stones just now.
ba-yu: You lost sente which you could have used to make your left group alive.
robertdg: Thank you for the remarks, they are very helpful
ba-yu: test: comment on move 26
ba-yu: doesn't work like this.
