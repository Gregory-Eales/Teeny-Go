C[Obbl: Good game
Leira: thanks for the game
Leira: it is possible that the system assigns color based on rank
Leira: not at random, as it should
Obbl: Well, I was on both sides of the rank too, so I don't know
Leira: maybe it's a coincidence
Obbl: I may need someone to explain this game to me
Leira: what game?
Obbl: I apparently made some good decisions, but I'm not sure I know what they all were
Obbl: This game
Leira: uhmmm, in 9x9 is a bit difficult
Obbl: Ah, true
Leira: one mistake can ruin the whole game
Leira: E5 is wrong by white
Leira: at least, I should use it to fight
Leira: more
Leira: H6 seems too passive
Obbl: Yeah, I wanted H5 but I must have been overly concerned about something
Leira: you could have gone in the other direction
Leira: C3 seems OK
Leira: I tried to live in two places at once
Leira: but being squished in the center as white is a sure loss
Leira: in a 9x9
Obbl: Okay, I think I can understand a little more
Obbl: Thank you
