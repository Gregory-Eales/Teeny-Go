C[48urhbfjieo3: those stones are not yours
48urhbfjieo3: it is seki
48urhbfjieo3: you cannot capture them
lifan: really?
lifan: wow, hadn't seen that coming.
lifan: ok
48urhbfjieo3: you cannot play at D1 or A1
lifan: goo lesson
48urhbfjieo3: its ok its tricky
lifan: I see it now
48urhbfjieo3: i still dont understand it fully, but in a situation like this neither color can attack the other because they share mutual liberties
48urhbfjieo3: different rules score it differently
48urhbfjieo3: i think in japanese they dont count as territory, but idk
lifan: k
48urhbfjieo3: well we can play anytime thanks for the game
lifan: ok later
lifan: wait
48urhbfjieo3: ok
lifan: I could have killed on f5
48urhbfjieo3: \[object Object\]
48urhbfjieo3: in a game i would have passed instead of playing j4
48urhbfjieo3: you see?
