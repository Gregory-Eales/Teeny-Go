C[LovroS: donno. I would have simply played F7. get the top right corner and should be enough to win.
LovroS: no, changed my mind. E5 looks bad, was a good move! =) :D hehe

C[LovroS: i think you could have pushed with G8 instead, bcs the two w ones on F7,F8 are not so strong and your center is good connected, so def kill them. this moves does not give you much.
