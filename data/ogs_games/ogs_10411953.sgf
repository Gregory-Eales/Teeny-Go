metaphysician splurgist :): i should apologize
metaphysician splurgist :): rather
Cr4zyP4nd4: ?
metaphysician splurgist :): for timeout ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: its fine
Cr4zyP4nd4: the game was pretty much over
metaphysician splurgist :): yes
metaphysician splurgist :): i wanted to fight
metaphysician splurgist :): the top group
metaphysician splurgist :): with j5
metaphysician splurgist :): but
Cr4zyP4nd4: sure, it was alive though
metaphysician splurgist :): and
metaphysician splurgist :): i passed
metaphysician splurgist :): one turn too early ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: more like 6 or 7 )
Cr4zyP4nd4: the left side is unresolved also
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): i shouldnt have passed
Cr4zyP4nd4: yup
metaphysician splurgist :): can we continue
metaphysician splurgist :): from here ?
metaphysician splurgist :): if i dont ask too much
metaphysician splurgist :): i want to j7
Cr4zyP4nd4: ill just give you the best variation:
metaphysician splurgist :): sure
Cr4zyP4nd4: starting with black:
metaphysician splurgist :): are you doing it ?
metaphysician splurgist :): i wanted to j7 for move 43
metaphysician splurgist :): but maybe
metaphysician splurgist :): you had a better idea ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: j6,  j7, e3, e2, a5, a6, a4, h6, j5, a3, b3, h1
metaphysician splurgist :): why doesnt black start with j7 ?
metaphysician splurgist :): if i'm not asking too much ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: then: g1, j3, j1, e4, h1 game over
metaphysician splurgist :): oh
metaphysician splurgist :): e4
metaphysician splurgist :): is filled
metaphysician splurgist :): you mean e3
metaphysician splurgist :): i think
Cr4zyP4nd4: no i dont
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): theres a stone
metaphysician splurgist :): in e4
Cr4zyP4nd4: just follow all of the moves ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Cr4zyP4nd4: j6, j7, e3, e2, a5, a6, a4, h6, j5, a3, b3, h1 then: g1, j3, j1, e4, h1 game over
metaphysician splurgist :): oh
metaphysician splurgist :): j6
metaphysician splurgist :): is balck right ?
Cr4zyP4nd4: yeah
Cr4zyP4nd4: j7 is worth the same number of points
Cr4zyP4nd4: but is more complicated
metaphysician splurgist :): so
metaphysician splurgist :): 20 seconds
metaphysician splurgist :): i'll do
metaphysician splurgist :): the other variation
metaphysician splurgist :): you mentionned
metaphysician splurgist :): here
metaphysician splurgist :): i wdont see why you j3
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): i would rather j8
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): maybe i'm taking too much of your time ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): say it if im bothering you ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but
Cr4zyP4nd4: on second look, i think j7 is worth like a point more:
metaphysician splurgist :): i was talking about the j7 one
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Cr4zyP4nd4: \[object Object\]
Cr4zyP4nd4: black wins the ko at the end, so he can fill that in whenever
metaphysician splurgist :): no ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i assumed that
metaphysician splurgist :): black didnt pass
metaphysician splurgist :): remember ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i said black shouldnt pass
metaphysician splurgist :): ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: ?
metaphysician splurgist :): in your variation
metaphysician splurgist :): white plays 2 times
Cr4zyP4nd4: \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): oh
metaphysician splurgist :): thats very interseting
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): i wouldnt do what you did
metaphysician splurgist :): i would try c9
metaphysician splurgist :): at move 54
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Cr4zyP4nd4: sure you can try that on you own
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): i'm not sure it works ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): anyways
Cr4zyP4nd4: it doesnt
metaphysician splurgist :): i wont take all your time
metaphysician splurgist :): if you want to replay
Cr4zyP4nd4: i swear I've given you the best variation
Cr4zyP4nd4: I've counted all of the moves
metaphysician splurgist :): i trust you ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): so now or someday
metaphysician splurgist :): if you want to play again
metaphysician splurgist :): its a honor
metaphysician splurgist :): for me ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: sure, lest play again when you are 15k send me a message then.
Cr4zyP4nd4: *lets
metaphysician splurgist :): sure :)
metaphysician splurgist :): does the game list
metaphysician splurgist :): not get erased ?
metaphysician splurgist :): i mean
metaphysician splurgist :): will i still be able to see you ? ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: sure
metaphysician splurgist :): so
metaphysician splurgist :): i only did 50 problems
metaphysician splurgist :): of tsumego
metaphysician splurgist :): i'll go again to you
metaphysician splurgist :): when i do at least 1000 ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: lol when you're 15k its good enough
Cr4zyP4nd4: best of luck. get strong.
metaphysician splurgist :): i play for fun ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): you'd rather say
metaphysician splurgist :): enjoy go :)
metaphysician splurgist :): lol
Cr4zyP4nd4: ^^ you can't really enjoy until you're strong ;)
metaphysician splurgist :): nah
Cr4zyP4nd4: meaning: it gets more and more fun as your level increases
metaphysician splurgist :): its fun hence why you want to become strong ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): sure
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): the begining
metaphysician splurgist :): has to be fun ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): or its no fun :)
metaphysician splurgist :): btw
metaphysician splurgist :): big thanks
metaphysician splurgist :): for the sayings
metaphysician splurgist :): i wanted that context a lot
Cr4zyP4nd4: np
metaphysician splurgist :): since i dont have a teacher :)
Cr4zyP4nd4: remember the most important proverb:
Cr4zyP4nd4: all proverbs are wrong
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): i also want
metaphysician splurgist :): thealike
metaphysician splurgist :): like
metaphysician splurgist :): the philosophy
metaphysician splurgist :): of go ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): not only tactical proverbs ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: become 1 dan
metaphysician splurgist :): what do you mean ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): its too early :)
Cr4zyP4nd4: yup
metaphysician splurgist :): the more i learn
Cr4zyP4nd4: its hard to understand the philosophy until you really start to understand the game
metaphysician splurgist :): the more i'm fascinated
metaphysician splurgist :): yes
metaphysician splurgist :): for the score
Cr4zyP4nd4: and you start to get it at 1 dan
metaphysician splurgist :): i didnt read it
metaphysician splurgist :): but i understood something
metaphysician splurgist :): when someone explained me
metaphysician splurgist :): the scoring system
metaphysician splurgist :): so
metaphysician splurgist :): since both players play stones
metaphysician splurgist :): 1 each turn
metaphysician splurgist :): and both need to pass
metaphysician splurgist :): for score
metaphysician splurgist :): there will be the same number of stones
Cr4zyP4nd4: and i'm like 6dan tygem, and I am like mid-beginner as far as understanding goes
metaphysician splurgist :): on field
metaphysician splurgist :): so
metaphysician splurgist :): only empty squares
metaphysician splurgist :): and dead stones
metaphysician splurgist :): matter
metaphysician splurgist :): i also understood that
metaphysician splurgist :): 2 pass on opposite turns
metaphysician splurgist :): can have an impact
metaphysician splurgist :): its a +1
Cr4zyP4nd4: yup thats the example of rules
metaphysician splurgist :): for white
Cr4zyP4nd4: right now you're learning the alphabet
Cr4zyP4nd4: then you need to learn words
Cr4zyP4nd4: and after you learn sentences and read a bunch of books
metaphysician splurgist :): but
Cr4zyP4nd4: then you can study the philosophy
metaphysician splurgist :): wont i get weaker
metaphysician splurgist :): if
metaphysician splurgist :): i dont have creativity
metaphysician splurgist :): ?
metaphysician splurgist :): i want to play creative style
Cr4zyP4nd4: as a beginner, you need fighting spirit more than creativity (kiai in japanese)
metaphysician splurgist :): but still too weak
metaphysician splurgist :): for that ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i have kiai by nature :)
Cr4zyP4nd4: you can't be creative if you can't hold a paint brush
metaphysician splurgist :): you can
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): it leads to nothing
metaphysician splurgist :): its a nuance :)
metaphysician splurgist :): anyways
metaphysician splurgist :): really
Cr4zyP4nd4: look at some 19x19 games
metaphysician splurgist :): thank you
metaphysician splurgist :): for all your time
Cr4zyP4nd4: np
metaphysician splurgist :): its still early
metaphysician splurgist :): i'll do tsumego
metaphysician splurgist :): a lot ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): then
metaphysician splurgist :): when i get quite good at 9x9
metaphysician splurgist :): i'll try 19x19 ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: a good rule of thumb:
Cr4zyP4nd4: the last thing ill leave you with
metaphysician splurgist :): yes ?
Cr4zyP4nd4: stick with 9x9 until you can win *every time* with a 3-stone handicap
Cr4zyP4nd4: that means against 25k or 7dan
Cr4zyP4nd4: after that switch up
metaphysician splurgist :): well
metaphysician splurgist :): i dont totally agree
metaphysician splurgist :): 9x9 has many corners
metaphysician splurgist :): it doesnt allow
metaphysician splurgist :): deep counter strategy
Cr4zyP4nd4: lol 
metaphysician splurgist :): it aaif you get too used to it
Cr4zyP4nd4: you don't have to trust me
metaphysician splurgist :): it will giv you a false sense of security ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): you need to play cornered
metaphysician splurgist :): ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: the point is what is efficient
metaphysician splurgist :): in 9x9
metaphysician splurgist :): efficiency is obvious
metaphysician splurgist :): but in 19x19
metaphysician splurgist :): it harder ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: you don't understand me
Cr4zyP4nd4: please:
metaphysician splurgist :): maybe ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: after you can win every 9x9 game with 3 stones you will learn *faster* on the 19x19
Cr4zyP4nd4: of course you could still learn on 9x9
metaphysician splurgist :): oh !
metaphysician splurgist :): sure
metaphysician splurgist :): i approve not only 100%
metaphysician splurgist :): but i would even say
metaphysician splurgist :): its pointless to play 19x19
metaphysician splurgist :): if you dont manage well 9x9
Cr4zyP4nd4: right
Cr4zyP4nd4: and I'm giving you criteria:
metaphysician splurgist :): but i wouldnt say stick with 9x9 all time ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: winning all 3 stone games is managing well enough
metaphysician splurgist :): well
Cr4zyP4nd4: beyond that you're getting too much into the minutia of 9x9 strategy, which is not that valuable in the long run
metaphysician splurgist :): theres the handicap stuff and all
Cr4zyP4nd4: 19x19 is real go
metaphysician splurgist :): exactly ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): yes
metaphysician splurgist :): i do believe it to
metaphysician splurgist :): 9x9 is like training area
metaphysician splurgist :): like
metaphysician splurgist :): when you get your driving license
metaphysician splurgist :): its not the focus ^^
Cr4zyP4nd4: yes
Cr4zyP4nd4: so trust stronger players!
metaphysician splurgist :): so we do agree now lol
metaphysician splurgist :): i want to trust you, trust me ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): its just
metaphysician splurgist :): sometimes
metaphysician splurgist :): i cant help to do silly stuff
metaphysician splurgist :): i told you
metaphysician splurgist :): i have a lot energy to spend
Cr4zyP4nd4: once you've lost your first 100 games you'll start to learn
Cr4zyP4nd4: everyone does
metaphysician splurgist :): o
metaphysician splurgist :): well
metaphysician splurgist :): for day 3
metaphysician splurgist :): i lost like 40 games
metaphysician splurgist :): maybe ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): probably more
Cr4zyP4nd4: keep losing
Cr4zyP4nd4: and use handicaps
metaphysician splurgist :): yes
metaphysician splurgist :): but lately
Cr4zyP4nd4: you need to lose for real
metaphysician splurgist :): i started to win :)
metaphysician splurgist :): :'(
Cr4zyP4nd4: non-handicap means your opponent isn't trying
metaphysician splurgist :): yes
metaphysician splurgist :): i understand ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but still
metaphysician splurgist :): higher k ranks
metaphysician splurgist :): still have more skill than me ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): so its sort of a challenge
metaphysician splurgist :): for me
metaphysician splurgist :): if i beat them
metaphysician splurgist :): then we can talk about handicap and all ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): so really
metaphysician splurgist :): thank you for all :)
Cr4zyP4nd4: sure later
metaphysician splurgist :): hope our game history
metaphysician splurgist :): doesnt get erased ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): so i can message you next time ^^
