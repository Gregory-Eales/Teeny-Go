C[simonjin: Good game
festosoon: Good game.
festosoon: It seems like you can for sure get at least one corner per game.
festosoon: What do you use attacking and capturing for?
simonjin: Gaining territory
festosoon: Right. When you are thinking about attacking or capturing, I wonder how much of your thinking is about your own pieces, and how much about your opponents?
festosoon: It just seems like, if you know that when you attack or capture, it is first for the sake of getting territory, you should be successful more often! :-)
festosoon: Or, maybe we need to imagine another KIND of move. A building kind of move.
simonjin: When I see that I am about to lose I try to make a territory in your space but it never seems to work
festosoon: Well, that's a pretty good strategy, but what about before then? 
simonjin: I try to gain as much space as possible
festosoon: How do you decide which space will gain as much space as possible?
festosoon: which move?
festosoon: Or, maybe, at the beginning, how do you look for the move that will gain you the most space?
simonjin: I try to think ahead to see what you might do and what you probably woulnd'nt
simonjin: Then I play where seems best
festosoon: That is good too. But, I think at the beginning, sometimes you have to first think about where the best place would be for you to play - before you think about where your opponent will play.
simonjin: I sometimes think WHa
simonjin: t
simonjin: Might be in a good place to gain more space in the following moves
festosoon: I think that is more what I am talking about. The other way of thinking is useful some of the time, but it is a RESPONDING position - making your move determined by your opponent; you can make a move that doesn't consider your opponents position, but is just the best move for you.
festosoon: I think especially early in the game before any close positions form between the two sides.
simonjin: Okay
festosoon: Let's play another - keep in mind how you are deciding where to play - especially at the beginning.
