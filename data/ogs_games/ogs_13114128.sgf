C[KJisdead: thanks
ReadyToGo!: likewise
ReadyToGo!: i chose the wrong move in both corners ^^
KJisdead: where ?
ReadyToGo!: top right and bottom right
KJisdead: what would you have played instead ?
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: yess
KJisdead: the top right i realised it was a mistake
KJisdead: i was hoping you dont play that and you didnt :P
ReadyToGo!: lol
KJisdead: bottom right
KJisdead: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: do you think it would go this way ?
ReadyToGo!: yes, this would have been more in line with my plan to take the right side
KJisdead: but here i can think of some interesting moves
ReadyToGo!: due to all my bad moves
ReadyToGo!: i only won because you did huge mistake with C9
KJisdead: yeah
KJisdead: i was worried about it
KJisdead: but i still played it :P
ReadyToGo!: lol
ReadyToGo!: that feeling :P
KJisdead: but in the variation i showed you 
ReadyToGo!: yes?
KJisdead: i am thinking if there is anything interesting
KJisdead: if i play e5
KJisdead: or around that
KJisdead: but seems there isnt, ant its your move anyway
ReadyToGo!: I am ok with sacrificing C5 and D4
KJisdead: yeah
KJisdead: thanks again for the game :)
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: i always miss those big ones
ReadyToGo!: it even has a special name, but i can't remember now tbh ^^
KJisdead: ^^
KJisdead: but i thiink you were winning even if i would not have made that C9 blunder
ReadyToGo!: Only if I had avoided the corner blunder too
ReadyToGo!: I think
ReadyToGo!: yea
KJisdead: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: you are winning
KJisdead: by more
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: told you i always miss those :P
ReadyToGo!: ^^
ReadyToGo!: they really are worth it
KJisdead: yeahh
ReadyToGo!: you should try to spot them
KJisdead: i will from now
ReadyToGo!: low hanging fruit :P
KJisdead: intutively border moves always seem strange
KJisdead: but they can be good
ReadyToGo!: it gives extensions down to the second line an added value
KJisdead: yeah
ReadyToGo!: border moves used to give me a lot of trouble
ReadyToGo!: If you don't mind
KJisdead: i am still new to this game
KJisdead: so
KJisdead: dont mind ?
ReadyToGo!: I also would recommend to go so obsessive onto the 3,3 points
KJisdead: i sometimes try that
KJisdead: sometimes work , sometimes it doesnt
KJisdead: but since you are 6k, i thought i should play safer
ReadyToGo!: some good people sometimes start with 3,3 point
ReadyToGo!: I believe (i am not a 3,3 player)
ReadyToGo!: but after the first 3,3 point
KJisdead: i played an 8 dan. he started with that
ReadyToGo!: you must extend
ReadyToGo!: when the group is save
ReadyToGo!: try to make a new group.
KJisdead: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: what would you have done if i did this
KJisdead: and is it a better move than what i did ?
ReadyToGo!: yes, I think so
KJisdead: fun game tho
ReadyToGo!: a lot better
KJisdead: thanks for the tips
ReadyToGo!:  I don't think I can prevent you from connecting
KJisdead: yeah
KJisdead: it could have been a winner
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
ReadyToGo!: Also G4 was to passive.
ReadyToGo!: *too
KJisdead: why did you play passive ?
ReadyToGo!: well I thought it was good enough
KJisdead: :P
ReadyToGo!: killing the stone in the corner is a solid effect
ReadyToGo!: while going in the middle is complicated decision, so I chose the easy route :P
ReadyToGo!: the bad route
KJisdead: yeahh, nice talking to you, i gotta go. would like to play again sometime, i am still a noob tho
ReadyToGo!: i am fairly new too
KJisdead: i started this feb
ReadyToGo!: sorry i am talking to much ^^
ReadyToGo!: well actually
KJisdead: thats alright
ReadyToGo!: then you may play longer by time :)
ReadyToGo!: but i am kind of addicted recently :P
KJisdead: longer ?
ReadyToGo!: yea
KJisdead: i am not addicted
KJisdead: i got addicted for 2 months , now i play casually
ReadyToGo!: march
ReadyToGo!: for me
KJisdead: nicee
ReadyToGo!: I try my best :)
KJisdead: you only play 9x9 ?
ReadyToGo!: yea pretty much
KJisdead: i came back to 9x9 yesterday iguess
KJisdead: i started with it
ReadyToGo!: I have played the occasional game on bigger boards
KJisdead: then moved on to bigger ones
ReadyToGo!: but they are a bit too long for my taste.
KJisdead: bigger ones are a lot more interesting, but they too long
KJisdead: same here :P
KJisdead: but they are way more interesting
ReadyToGo!: 9² can be pretty interesting too
KJisdead: not as much as the big ones
KJisdead: trust me
KJisdead: wow
KJisdead: you have played 2000 games
KJisdead: you really addicted :P
ReadyToGo!: well it's been a couple months ^^
KJisdead: i have only played 200 
ReadyToGo!: the benefit of 9² is that you play more games
KJisdead: and i havent played much bigger games either, only 16
KJisdead: i like that about them
ReadyToGo!: on big boards we are perhaps about even
KJisdead: i dont have patience these days to play long
ReadyToGo!: because i am also a bit clueless
KJisdead: most probably
KJisdead: do you play any other game ?
ReadyToGo!: how do you mean?
KJisdead: i play blitz chess too
KJisdead: no not blitz, bullet
ReadyToGo!: ah, no i am not a big chess player.
KJisdead: me neither
KJisdead: but i play it
KJisdead: for fun
ReadyToGo!: It never was able to get interest me nearly as much as Go did since last march
KJisdead: why do you think that is ?
KJisdead: what does go have which chess doesnt ?
ReadyToGo!: Simple rules and common patterns.
KJisdead: if thats the case , chess is simple too
ReadyToGo!: Chess seems like a big mess of rules
KJisdead: i play 1min both sides
ReadyToGo!: no each piece has special functions
KJisdead: thats easy
ReadyToGo!: movements i mean
KJisdead: it just takes a few games to get used to that
ReadyToGo!: i am not saying that chess is difficult
ReadyToGo!: but that it's less intrigueing.
KJisdead: its the same difficulty as go
ReadyToGo!: Go has more complex behaviour
ReadyToGo!: I would claim more complex then chess
KJisdead: not sure, chess has too
ReadyToGo!: but the rules are extremely simple.
KJisdead: both the games
KJisdead: go and chess
KJisdead: are superior than the limits of human mind
ReadyToGo!: go is literally you just play alternatingly
KJisdead: so both are equally complex for us
ReadyToGo!: and place stones
ReadyToGo!: and someone ends up with more empty space
ReadyToGo!: Chess is not as elegant.
ReadyToGo!: That's just my opinion of course.
KJisdead: i like both
KJisdead: sometimes i play one
KJisdead: sometimes the other
KJisdead: depending on mood
ReadyToGo!: ok :)
KJisdead: so cya :)
ReadyToGo!: good evening 
KJisdead: good evening
