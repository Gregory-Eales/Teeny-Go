C[Goloser12345: thanks
sipejo: Can you tell me what I should have done betteR?
Goloser12345: yes
Goloser12345: your second move
Goloser12345: it was too far away from your first 
Goloser12345: and connected to mine
Goloser12345: so you spent haf the time trying to defend it
Goloser12345: rather than making territory
sipejo: I understand. Thanks :)
sipejo: Should have done F4?
Goloser12345: F4 is the prfect move
Goloser12345: even F5
sipejo: I see, and then start a second group.
sipejo: Do you have time for a rematch?
Goloser12345: yep
