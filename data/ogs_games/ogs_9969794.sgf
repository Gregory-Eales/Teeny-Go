C[aufwieder: thanks
Goptimal: gg
Goptimal: aufwiedersehen
aufwieder: how to respond to D7?
aufwieder: not sure what i did wrong
aufwieder: maybe losing the C7 stone by black C8 was smaller than protecting H3?
Goptimal: i dont quite know..
Goptimal: maybe you have to fight at d6
Goptimal: or cut at e4
Goptimal: i think you just have to split black somehow and provoke a fight
Goptimal: d8 gives black too many sente moves
