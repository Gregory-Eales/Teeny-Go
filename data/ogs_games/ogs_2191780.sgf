C[doromix1.6: i don't know why i do so many useless move xD
HikaruTim: Actually, you have played a very strong game from the start up until now.  I can only find one mistake you made which was F1
HikaruTim: Instead of F1 you should of played D9
HikaruTim: But I didn't read the top correctly and fooled around with B7 instead of saving the top group
HikaruTim: It has been a very interesting game that could have gone either way so that is nice
