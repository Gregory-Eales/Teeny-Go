C[1StepAtATime: Thanks
1StepAtATime: Try to avoid putting stones in your own territory
Migaki: I'm not very good, but thanks! ^^
Migaki: Alright, thanks for the tip ^^
1StepAtATime: You take away your own points 
1StepAtATime: You are welcome
Migaki: really?
1StepAtATime: Remember to have fun playing go :)
Migaki: Of course! xD
1StepAtATime: Yes, in Japanese scoring we count the area inside
1StepAtATime: so if you put your stones inside your area you will have less area left
Migaki: Hm...I figured that it counts your own stones as well...
Migaki: Ah, I understand that now
1StepAtATime: In chinese scoring it does, but not in Japanese scoring
Migaki: Maybe we could play again some other time? I'll work to get better xP
Migaki: Oh, I see...thanks for the tip
1StepAtATime: I'll open another game
1StepAtATime: if you want you can join it
Migaki: Really? Thanks!
