C[oldzephyr2000: My job as white is to try and take close to half.  The 5.5 points of komi means I do not have to win more territory
oldzephyr2000: H8 is not helpful to you.  
NEWOLDGUY: good to know
NEWOLDGUY: ok
oldzephyr2000: You're not going to be able to make that group live
oldzephyr2000: Do you know about eyes?

C[NEWOLDGUY: yes trying to not make any yet

C[NEWOLDGUY: straight lines is abjective
oldzephyr2000: My point is that there is no way to make eyes in the uper left because there is not enough room

C[oldzephyr2000: My objective is to keep your stones isolated.
oldzephyr2000: B6 a decent move
NEWOLDGUY: i am tryong cirlce you

oldzephyr2000: You can encircle me, but I can make eyes.
