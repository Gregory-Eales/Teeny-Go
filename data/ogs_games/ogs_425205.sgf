C[rgatti: Have a good game!
Irina_Phoenix: ooo.. We are on equal footing, I guess.

C[rgatti: Close enough, at least as far as the rating on this is concerned.

C[Irina_Phoenix: This feels like learning Quorridor did to me.
Irina_Phoenix: Which is also a game with very simple rules - even simpler - but so much different strategy.
rgatti: I don't think I've played that

C[Irina_Phoenix: Its on BGA - it's a fun game.
rgatti: Yeah, I remember learning Go was recognizing why some things were better than others

C[Irina_Phoenix: I am doing stuff wrong.
rgatti: It's okay.  I think you often have to see why they are wrong to learn to avoid them

C[rgatti: Quick question: If I played J8, what would you do?  (I'm not going to)
Irina_Phoenix: nothing. bc I think that could be taken, right? 
Irina_Phoenix: don't u think? it would be a removed stone?
rgatti: You would need to play H8
rgatti: If I played both J8 and J8, then your shape couldn't form 2 eyes
rgatti: er,J8 and H8
rgatti: but until I play one of them, you wouldn't need to play the other
Irina_Phoenix: but it could still be captured
Irina_Phoenix: isn't it that if they can be easily captured?
Irina_Phoenix: I really dont'know.
rgatti: Yes, but the rest of your shape is surrounded, so once you capture them, I can eventually capture your entire structure
Irina_Phoenix: ohhh.
Irina_Phoenix: okay, well I have to go.
Irina_Phoenix: let's try it i gyuess.

C[rgatti: okay, so if you pass here, you'll see what happens...
rgatti: Also, this is a good link: http://senseis.xmp.net/?LifeAndDeath
rgatti: Oh, you have to go?
rgatti: It's okay, you can read about the shapes via that link
rgatti: It helps to have an understanding of what shapes are alive or how to protect/kill shapes
rgatti: Actually, if you pass, I think I'll just pass to wrap up the game (since it's already lopsided).  No rush to finish, though.  I don't mind having ongoing correspondence games
rgatti: Thanks for playing!  And have fun learning!
rgatti: I'm looking for Phel's comments, but I think I can't see them because the game isn't finished yet?
