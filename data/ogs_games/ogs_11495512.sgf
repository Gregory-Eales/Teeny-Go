C[pOngyBoy: lol
pOngyBoy: gg
froofy: gg
pOngyBoy: i told u i'm noob
pOngyBoy: thk for the game
froofy: You pressured me pretty good
froofy: I didn't think I'd win.
pOngyBoy: nah
pOngyBoy: c ya around
froofy: \[object Object\]
pOngyBoy: oh
pOngyBoy: i didn't think much
pOngyBoy: thx for your advice
pOngyBoy: good move
froofy: The "free" move you gave me allowed me enough points to win.
froofy: Not really free, but the left was worth more than the right.
pOngyBoy: yep
pOngyBoy: my misstake
froofy: I have another thing for you.
froofy: Not that it matters so much usually.
froofy: But I've sometimes run into it.
froofy: In your last game you played a hanging connection at the top.
froofy: If you need more influence away from where you play, it's good.
froofy: But you were safe there.
froofy: And if not a direct connection, you give 2 ko threats, otherwise 0.
froofy: It
froofy: It's only a couple points, so not that big, but I've lost on that before.
froofy: Does that make any sense?
pOngyBoy: srry i'm too noob to understand
pOngyBoy: lol
pOngyBoy: thx anyway i g2g
froofy: gg x2
