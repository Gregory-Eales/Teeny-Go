C[helios404: you win
RedLeopard: you attack too soon
helios404: may be
RedLeopard: once I turn at the bottom you have to take away an outside liberty first
RedLeopard: then I protect to live, but you get to play elsewhere first -- that is fair
RedLeopard: if you play to kill when it cannot be killed, you lose the game :(
helios404: thx
RedLeopard: thanks for the games!
