C[metaphysician splurgist :): time to resign it seems ^^
Deep Scholar: yep :(
metaphysician splurgist :): wanted to start a ko ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): ty for the game :)
Deep Scholar: it is pretty rock solid to prevent that
metaphysician splurgist :): lol i saw ^^
Deep Scholar: can be bad in 7 komi as it draws alot
metaphysician splurgist :): yes ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): ii'm wondering about the .5 ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): why dont you 6.5 ^^
Deep Scholar: well i like draw im a weird one ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: interesting variations
metaphysician splurgist :): ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): ecxpected the bot to tenuki this early :)
Deep Scholar: usually bots tenuki when it is lost for me
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: ah on that one it plays f3 after g2 ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): loool
metaphysician splurgist :): this bot really doesnt like kos lool
Deep Scholar: ko's are bad with most bots
Deep Scholar: it is like i won so no ko for you ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): lool
metaphysician splurgist :): i loove kos ^^
Deep Scholar: kos can get interesting and confusing in my book when their is two on the board :(
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: currently it like d5 after d4 in the variation
Deep Scholar: or f2 i mean
metaphysician splurgist :): the thing is 9x9 is small ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): you cant apply same strategies :)
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: dont be fooled it is compilicated
metaphysician splurgist :): yes i know ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but its still fun :)
Deep Scholar: some lines i don't want to see the light of day as i try to avoid them
metaphysician splurgist :): oh ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i kinda like these :)
metaphysician splurgist :): i think we get deeper plays from such moves :)
metaphysician splurgist :): its always interesting^^
Deep Scholar: some get into large sekis that confuse the programs evalution
metaphysician splurgist :): oh ^^
Deep Scholar: some openings are 30-40 moves deep in my book
metaphysician splurgist :): i see ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): since the board is small its kinda always the same^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i tried many weird openings on 9x9 :)
Deep Scholar: but some novelties destroy all that thoery :D
metaphysician splurgist :): lool
metaphysician splurgist :): i always play novelty lol ^^
Deep Scholar: the program has gone through about 5 variations over about 5 years i have work on the project
metaphysician splurgist :): oh :)
metaphysician splurgist :): so its not self learning ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: no im not a programmer so i  do it the hard way as i carefully do each move in the opening book by hand
metaphysician splurgist :): i see ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
Deep Scholar: it is probably because black is to close to the edge of the board to live
metaphysician splurgist :): \[object Object\]
metaphysician splurgist :): yes :)
metaphysician splurgist :): the 2-1 points are usually vital ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): not always^^
Deep Scholar: the program is more of a alphago master before master was a thing
metaphysician splurgist :): ooooh
metaphysician splurgist :): really ?
Deep Scholar: yes
metaphysician splurgist :): i'm a big fan of master^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i dont like alphago zero ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but i love master's style^^
Deep Scholar: minus is the zero i am the master
metaphysician splurgist :): yes^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but you use alphago engine ?
Deep Scholar: it will surpass me one day :(
Deep Scholar: nope
metaphysician splurgist :): similar method then i guess^^
Deep Scholar: i use crazystone but my version wins about 80% of the time
Deep Scholar: against it
Deep Scholar: crazystone on goquest is about 2250-2300 on goquest
metaphysician splurgist :): oh ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but now i'm really curious lol ^^
Deep Scholar: it is pretty lame 
metaphysician splurgist :): but
metaphysician splurgist :): you dont play big board?
metaphysician splurgist :): master was beautiful on big board^^
Deep Scholar: well i play the 9x9 because it reminds me of the chess board which i  play chess on ICCF
metaphysician splurgist :): oh ^^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but 19x19 is much more fun ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): so you never tried it on 19x19 then ?
Deep Scholar: yeah maybe one day i will do a master version on 19x19 one day
metaphysician splurgist :): i'm very excited about it ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): not yours, but more genrally play against master^^
Deep Scholar: crazystone is sub par on 19x19 leela excel at it
metaphysician splurgist :): but i care more at style than at result/strength^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i love master's style :)
metaphysician splurgist :): i dont like zero's:)
Deep Scholar: plus i run a low quality computer so result may vary
metaphysician splurgist :): nothing with strength^^
metaphysician splurgist :): yes ofc^^
metaphysician splurgist :): but its still ok i guess^^
metaphysician splurgist :): for casual games:)
metaphysician splurgist :): anyways ty for the game^^
Deep Scholar: np challenge me again some time
metaphysician splurgist :): i'd like to ^^
Deep Scholar: ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i played a lot with zenbot in the past^^
metaphysician splurgist :): maybe i can add you too :)
Deep Scholar: i want to play it since i don't have zen
metaphysician splurgist :): its ok ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i like zen on 9x9, but not on 19x19 ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): then next time^^
Deep Scholar: then i could do some testes on it ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): zen is too solid to my taste^^
metaphysician splurgist :): sure :)
metaphysician splurgist :): i like to play weird^^
metaphysician splurgist :): zen liked the games with me ^^
Deep Scholar: zen is suppose to be stronger than crazystone
metaphysician splurgist :): hope its gonna be fun with us too ^^
Deep Scholar: :D
metaphysician splurgist :): lol so maybe i can add you and next time we do like 10 crazy games in a row^^
Deep Scholar: sure maybe one at a time as mine plays the same thing every time :D
metaphysician splurgist :): i wont play the same thing twice lool
metaphysician splurgist :): ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): ok then ^^
