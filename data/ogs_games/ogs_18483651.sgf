C[arlekino: thabnkyou
arlekino: Leela seems to favour 4-4 opening but often I can't hold on to enough territory when I try it and someone invades
dmadness: who is leela
arlekino: AI
dmadness: oh
dmadness: I have a friend at Google ...he has an alpha go version for 9x9
dmadness: amazing
dmadness: that's where I got that move
dmadness: I have a better one but haven't worked all the reponses
arlekino: you have the reading ability to make use of it. I have a long road ahead of me there yet :)
dmadness: I'll bring that online in a couple weeks
