C[donutm: good
donutm: I don't care for e5 opening
likebox: HA HA
likebox: as black?
donutm: it doesn't apply in larger boards
donutm: so it seems like a waste of time
likebox: maybe yes, maybe no, it's hard to tell, because it's so "miai"
likebox: I mean, you take one corner, I take another,
donutm: don't know that word
likebox: all that's left is the center stone
likebox: "alternate possibilities"
donutm: oh
likebox: Like "you take one, I take the other"
likebox: The opening is REALLY miai
likebox: so the center is the only non-miai point
likebox: that's the idea
donutm: on a 19 x 19 board no one would play the center
donutm: it's a cheezy opening in 9x9
likebox: It's hard to play 
donutm: and doesn't develop skills
likebox: I mean, some people do play center

C[likebox: gg
donutm: thanks
donutm: gg
likebox: thanks
likebox: that was interesting
likebox: I screwed up the bottom
likebox: I think I might have eked out a few points there
donutm: e5 is not a fun opening
likebox: I only play that!
likebox: On 9x9 and 13x13
likebox: On 19x19 rarely
donutm: I see
likebox: It's too hard to play
likebox: I mean, the idea is that "it will be useful one day in the far future"
likebox: And it's a ladder breaker
donutm: for me it's like learning bad habits
likebox: It's not clear!
likebox: One way to figure it out is to train an AI
donutm: like picking ones nose on a date
likebox: on 9x9
likebox: HA HA!!
donutm: AI's don't play e5
likebox: I think it might be the best opening
likebox: on 9x9??
likebox: They DON'T??
likebox: I'm shocked!
likebox: Really??
donutm: no ...
likebox: What do they play?
donutm: because they lose to g5
donutm: g7
likebox: Oh!!
likebox: Oh!!!
donutm: or g6
likebox: G7???
likebox: Weird!!
donutm: have you played the AI engine here?
donutm: the good ones?
likebox: Not on 9x9
donutm: verify
likebox: And never the really good ones
likebox: I BELIEVE YOU!
likebox: Why would you lie??
likebox: I mean, it's interesting to me!
donutm: one more?
likebox: Sure!
likebox: Help!
