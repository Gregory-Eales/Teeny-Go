C[Respekto: whao 
Respekto: again :-)
lapinneau: mhm not sure?
Respekto: what ?
lapinneau: your upper right group is alive, you got a good chunk of the bottom, would have thought it was a close game?
Respekto: It is not 
lapinneau: you're right
lapinneau: my bad
Respekto: I know 
lapinneau: :)
Respekto: Maybe you should just say thanks, instead of proving me why I am wrong resigning ;-)
lapinneau: wow i'm sorry, meant no offense lah
lapinneau: sensitive much, eh?
Respekto: A lot, mainly when it comes to unranked games :-)
lapinneau: was just discussing the game
lapinneau: why is that?
lapinneau: anyway, thx for the games, had fun. hope to play again
Respekto: I always notice something 
Respekto: When I start losing, everyone is explaining me what I should have done 
Respekto: It makes me a sensitive player I suppose.
