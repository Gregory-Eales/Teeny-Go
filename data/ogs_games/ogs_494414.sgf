TTD: ok
TTD: np
TTD: restart the game
nico256: I think it's ok now
nico256: ... how to restart the game?
nico256: thx
nico256: I would like to ask ... where can I see the notification of the request??
nico256: Oh I see
Migaki: the players should send you a request or post an open game request...
Migaki: then you accept it 
Migaki: mhm
Migaki: Oh, well, if the player sends you a request directly, up at the top right corner of your screen, there should be a little blue box with a number in it.
Migaki: That number indicates the number of notifications you have and that box, when you click it, shows you your notifications.
Migaki: However, some players just put out open game requests
Migaki: You can find that in two places.
