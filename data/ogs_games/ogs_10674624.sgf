C[cinereaste: Thank you, too. Well-played. 
cinereaste: Question: Was Black 23 (at C2) a mistake?
]
(;B[]
C[Neandertaler: Yes, I think so. That move costed you four points and the game.
Neandertaler: What were you fearing not to play D1? For me to cut at D2 seems not possible.
cinereaste: I think I was fearing something like this, which might allow you to live in the lower left corner?
cinereaste: \[object Object\]
Neandertaler: I see. Good sequence - i didn't see that in the game.
Neandertaler: What, if 5 (E1) is played elsewhere - say at B2? 
Neandertaler: Doesn't work, because of lack of ko threats.
Neandertaler: Did you think about D2 instead of D1?
Neandertaler: \[object Object\]
Neandertaler: That would have been two points better and that would have been enough.
Neandertaler: \[object Object\]
cinereaste: Thank you.
