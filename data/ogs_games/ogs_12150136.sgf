C[smurph: delete a4 from your memory right now :) it leaves way too much aji... and is only useful in fringe cases where you do need the extra eyespace

C[Vivian_Vex: I did need the eye space thuogh
smurph: a5 does the same but preserves a3 not being gote
Vivian_Vex: Huh...true

C[smurph: well
smurph: in this case you did need the extra eyespace

C[smurph: slight problem
Vivian_Vex: Yeah, I have never seen that play
smurph: thanks for the game :)
Vivian_Vex: Thank you for this game. I learned a lot and wills tudy it more!
Vivian_Vex: Yeah, though that was back when I would consider myself a lot less good than i am now
Vivian_Vex: And was a lot less receptive to stuff.
Vivian_Vex: As in things didn't stay with me as well as they do now. XD
smurph: well whatever the language, you first have to learn the vocab
Vivian_Vex: Oh! i didn't see that
smurph: as a rule of thumb
smurph: in symmetric positions, just play on the point of symmetry
Vivian_Vex: Yeah I try to do that unless I feel I can get more on one side.
smurph: well then, see you around 
Vivian_Vex: Yup!
Vivian_Vex: Again thank you ^_^
smurph: ywyw
ecopenguin: common double snapback shape
EricJHan: Yes

EricJHan: But i'm a noob of noobs

ecopenguin: (and why it's good spesificly then)
ecopenguin: whut
ecopenguin: yeah, but i mean
