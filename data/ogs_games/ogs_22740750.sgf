C[vectork: ty, great game!
RaiOni: yes, really interesting. Thanks :)
vectork: was there a way out for black?
vectork: dont think so
RaiOni: I could not see one.
vectork: yeah
vectork: thanks!
RaiOni: I have the ko and there not really any ko threats. But I could be wrong
vectork: yes. thought i can prevent your two eyes on the bottom
vectork: but not enught time/liberties
RaiOni: Yes, my idea was to kill everything on top, before you can kill my group on the bottom
vectork: yes
vectork: not way for me to protect against the ko
vectork: \[object Object\]
vectork: but this was a mistake. i filled up one of my liberties without need
vectork: instead of doing f8
vectork: okay, anyways. good game!
vectork: yes, youre right
vectork: okay, was too bold to not protect against your peep and letting you cut me :) but worth it :)
vectork: oh wow
vectork: bur can you make life in the corner?
vectork: \[object Object\]
vectork: oh, i see
RaiOni: \[object Object\]
RaiOni: But I think I could still capture
RaiOni: yes really interesting
RaiOni: \[object Object\]
RaiOni: I still do not know, if you just take the left side, who would win
RaiOni: Probably still enough for white becuase of B6
RaiOni: No you can kill the group, but I can reduce your territory.
RaiOni: You can nit save your stone at G9
RaiOni: \[object Object\]
