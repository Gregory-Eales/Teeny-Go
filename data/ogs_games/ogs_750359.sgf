C[werewolfhk: Black won....why did they end the game?
werewolfhk: Up in the left corner black had all of those pieces taken if played and on the right hand side black would take all of those white pieces on the bottom right if played out by preventing a connection until only one eye was left allowing capture. White had no chance in the top right and bottom left corners really, so black should be the winner ending with roughly 34 points vs. 12 points.
werewolfhk: oh..nevermind I just read the top haha
