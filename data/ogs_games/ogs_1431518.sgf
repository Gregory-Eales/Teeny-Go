RoboTeddy: ready?
Talbo: Hi, and thanks for the hint ;)
RoboTeddy: ok, have fun :D
RoboTeddy: I've never done one of these tournaments before, I didn't realize the games are so immediately one after the other
RoboTeddy: fun though!
Talbo: Have a good game 
RoboTeddy: let me know if you weren't ready yet, btw -- I hope i didn't start too early
RoboTeddy: (happy to sit for a minute without making my move to even it up if so)
Talbo: If you're the last one, they are 
Talbo: :)
