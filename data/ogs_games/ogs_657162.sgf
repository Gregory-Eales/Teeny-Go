C[MarcusRienmel: Thank you. =)
jesultra: Thank you.
MarcusRienmel: Another?
jesultra: I was grabbing straws.
jesultra: Sure, lets try.
MarcusRienmel: What's grabbing straws?
jesultra: That is an expression from when you are drowning, and desparate to grab onto something.
MarcusRienmel: You succeded. =P
jesultra: In this case, you had won, and my moves at G3 and C8 were not really good.
jesultra: Will you challenge me to another game.  I am not familiar with this interface.
MarcusRienmel: I did.
jesultra: I just accepted.
