C[raro361: nothing worked for black really
raro361: sorry, for white
raro361: okay (y)
raro361: no. that was supposed to be a thumbs up, but it didn't work
raro361: well, okay
raro361: what sort of tips?
raro361: did you see the variation when i played it, at A2?
raro361: that's okay...
raro361: well, you get a feel for the most efficient move as you play more.
raro361: on 9x9 it's a different strategy to 19x19.
raro361: i always used to play 19x19, but now a little 9x9. i find 9x9 more difficult to understand.
raro361: but...basically the corners are easiest to defend and get territory, because you already have two walls to your territory.
raro361: 19x19 is so complex you have to use your intuition/feelings more.
raro361: yes, it's normal to start on 9x9 and understand a few basic things.
raro361: so... an empty triangle is usually bad.
raro361: stones with two or 3 spaces between them are usually good
raro361: sorry, i mean 2 or 3 intersections between them - that's usually good.
raro361: can you see the variation i'm playing right now? the latest move is at C5...?
raro361: well, if a player puts their stone in the middle then it's easy to atttack that stone.
raro361: because when they put the stone there, it's outnumbered by nearby stones straight away.
raro361: can you see the variation on the board (7 stones on the board i'm seeing now)
raro361: ?
raro361: oh......
raro361: i was going to show some good shape
raro361: i did rewind the game, yes.
raro361: it's on move 7
raro361: but, you'd need to see it.
raro361: too long to explain in words
raro361: ok, what move number is it on now?
raro361: you can't see what i'm doing, can you?
raro361: darn.
raro361: too difficult to explain unless we see the same board
raro361: how about we play a game?
bugwise: that robot should have done A2
bugwise: yeah i see that now 
bugwise: are you asking why
bugwise: okay 
bugwise: hey would you mind giving tips
bugwise: how to move or use each stone more effeicent
bugwise: i spelled that wrong
bugwise: so it comes down to playing more and yes
bugwise: yeah i tried one 19 but i was completely lost and had no idea why
bugwise: thats probably why then because i tried to do the meta stuff without completely understanding it
bugwise: so the base thing
bugwise: is that good really what if a player just puts their stones in the middle of it?
bugwise: no 
bugwise: did you rewind the game
bugwise: move number
bugwise: yes
bugwise: i found it
bugwise: no
bugwise: sure
