C[yassanwkj: thanks

yassanwkj: bye
yassanwkj: no idea
yassanwkj: OK
yassanwkj:  bye
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: did the corner swap make a difference?
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: it looks like the black corner points are more substantial
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: yeah
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: why was that? because white was weaker on center right than black was on center left?
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: I mean, why did it work out that way?
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: anyway, I saved the game and I'll check it out
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: bye
viridiumef91b4a47af54987: wonder if 36 at G3 would have changed the outcome of the game
