C[reinsor: wow
bricmar: you've done a really good job in the life and death game
bricmar: but didn't pay enough attention
bricmar: to the territory
bricmar: which is the opposite you usually do
reinsor: I do?
bricmar: well, you usually prefer a more balanced game
reinsor: well I guess I can't do both at the same timw
reinsor: yes, that's mostly in the first moves that I try to get pieces all over the board
reinsor: but most of the times they are unconnected and eventuall captured
