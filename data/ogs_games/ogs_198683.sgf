C[redacted: 4-4 isn't such a great idea on the 9x9 board.

C[redacted: This move doesn't accomplish anything. Neither white stone is really threatened, and it doesn't claim any territory for itself.

C[redacted: Why let white connect on the right? Black should respond to being kicked; f5 is the natural thought, h5 is also possible.

C[redacted: This forces white to live -- to win.

C[redacted: The white groups are strong and alive, and black has left weaknesses at f5 and e2; the left side isn't as large as it looks due to a5. Black won't be able to overcome komi.
marcusa: not that being glib is any excuse for ineptitude, but i was pretty happy to do as well as i did. i never feel like the same komi on the small board is possible to overcome. I did not know that the 4-4 point was bad. I ought to have since there is no center. I was just trying to make you small and survive.
