C[yyqwerty: why they stopped?
Daisuki-chan: There's nothing real to do.
yyqwerty: maybe invasion to the right bottom corner?
Daisuki-chan: I don't think there's enough space there...
Daisuki-chan: Where would you invade?
yyqwerty: G2
Daisuki-chan: \[object Object\]
yyqwerty: i'm not sure. just thoughts. I'm new here and I see that a lot of games end in the middle
Daisuki-chan: Well, on 9x9 this is the end because there's no way to make two eyes without the other player ignoring it.
Daisuki-chan: Can you see my variation?
Daisuki-chan: The goal is to make two eyes at either H1 and J2 or H2 and J1...
yyqwerty: yep, I moved on f2
yyqwerty: Is it a good way to start playing go on 9x9?
Daisuki-chan: Supposedly...I guess it's good for learning to fight...
Daisuki-chan: Anyway you see my full variation?
Daisuki-chan: Black can't do anything like that...
Daisuki-chan: H2 was hoping to keep H1 and J2 as eyes but there's no way.
Daisuki-chan: You need more?
yyqwerty: No, thank you for these explanations
Daisuki-chan: Yout wanted J2? But that ruins eye potential.
yyqwerty: You variation ends at 40 move
Daisuki-chan: \[object Object\]
yyqwerty: I don't see aanything else
Daisuki-chan: Did it update?
yyqwerty: yep
yyqwerty: oh
Daisuki-chan: H3 is because you need that either way...
Daisuki-chan: But I guess you need G1 and J3 too.
Daisuki-chan: In any of those cases it's easy to prevent two eyes...
yyqwerty: yes I agree
yyqwerty: Have a nice day
yyqwerty: Goodbye
Daisuki-chan: Bye. ;p
