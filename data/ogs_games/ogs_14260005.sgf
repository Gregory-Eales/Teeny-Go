C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: thanks for the game
ReadyToGo!: gg
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: Ko's can be a bitch
ReadyToGo!: yep :O
ReadyToGo!: this here really came as a surprise to me
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: yeah, you were clearly ahead
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: but the throw in is something that is not easily forseen
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I've had it happen to me a few times and it really hurts
ReadyToGo!: which throw in do you mean?
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I was blindsided
ReadyToGo!: A2?
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: move 46
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: A2
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: to start the ko
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: and since i don't have any weakness, and the right is got a few
ReadyToGo!: yea :3
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: It's favorable
ReadyToGo!: I was thinking it wouldn't be a problem
ReadyToGo!: I did not seriously think through what would happen
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: no, it's like 6 extra steps
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: white can play h8 instead of j4
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: that would secure the top for sure for white because of the connect and capture situation for black
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: g3 was a target
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: and there's a throw in sequence I think
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: \[object Object\]
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: there might even be better for white...
ReadyToGo!: \[object Object\]
ReadyToGo!: at d3 can be captured
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: \[object Object\]
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I was actually hoping for this in the game
ReadyToGo!: also C5 was a mistake, I think
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: oh yeah, I see now
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I am trying to work it through now
ReadyToGo!: it seemed like a good forcing move but actually it's actually reducting liberties
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: yeah, I guess you're right
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: It doesn't work
ReadyToGo!: I was afraid too though
ReadyToGo!: I thought C3 would make headroom on the side
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: \[object Object\]
ReadyToGo!: and then G3 is make it rock solid :S
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: but I don't have any as many threats this time
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: \[object Object\]
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: nm
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: well good game!
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: thanks again
ReadyToGo!: yea, gg
ReadyToGo!: thanks as well!
gcsdupau: no tricks for black in top right ?
gcsdupau: after C1, J4, ..
gcsdupau: nice one
