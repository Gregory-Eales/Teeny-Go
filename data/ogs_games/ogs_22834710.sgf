Elmindreda_Go: If you wanna play more I'm down for whatever board
Elmindreda_Go: I just don't play white on big board
Counting Zenist: Is there a custom 17x17 board that we can setup?

Elmindreda_Go:  19x19 sounds fun though
Elmindreda_Go: Yea ive heard about 17x17
Counting Zenist: should be the same with 19x19 I feel, not sure about the komi
