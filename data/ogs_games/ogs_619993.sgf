C[Andigen: thanks
Ryuk*: Yeah
Ryuk*: lol
Ryuk*: How long have you been playing though?
Andigen: I've learned playing a few years ago, but I only played irregularly. And the last time I played was already months if not more than a year ago.
Andigen: And you?
Ryuk*: Eh pretty much the same
Ryuk*: Man
Ryuk*: I hate people that take forever to think about their moves =/
Ryuk*: Though the main problem when playing you I felt like you didnt understand the concept of living or dying 
Ryuk*: Like white had no room to find life in the top area
Andigen: yes I know, but I wanted to know if I could provoke a mistake
Ryuk*: Ohe
Ryuk*: I see
Andigen: like playing e1 instead of catching my 3 stones
Andigen: If this would have happened, I would have won. If you don't play it, but you answers every stone I put in your territory with another stone you put in your own territory in order to defen, I'm at least not loosing points
Andigen: *defend
Ryuk*: Yeah
Ryuk*: until I passed =P
Andigen: yes
Andigen: ok, bye
