C[monster1: here is some advice
monster1: are you trying to attack/kill or map out territory
rasavatta: Nothing at all... I'm trying something new 
monster1: ok
rasavatta: Just experimenting 
rasavatta: Looking how it turns out 
monster1: every move should either be an attack to kill or to take territory
monster1: a very good move does both at the same time
monster1: ... oh ... a move can defend too
monster1: 3 options
