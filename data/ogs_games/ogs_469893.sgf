C[Wobble: Do you see which piece is in atari/understand the word atari?
Becky: No/no.
Wobble: atari is like check in chess
Wobble: a piece/group is in atari if it can be taken next go - you remember when pieces are taken in go?
Becky: Oh, so my piece at J5 is in atari
Becky: Oh dear
Becky: Uh, hmm
Becky: I also clicked some stuff
Wobble: yes it is in atari
Becky: And no longer have a black piece at the end of my mouse
Wobble: :P
Becky: I now have an A
Becky: one moment...
Wobble: what did you click?
Wobble: did you click analyze game?
Becky: The back arrow
Becky: and then the A
Wobble: do you have a button that says back to game?
Wobble: above the chat box
Wobble: and yes the piece at J5 is in atari :)
Wobble: and I like that if I hover over where we write J5 it highlights the piece, this site is nice :)
Becky: Oooh I thought I'd played but my piece is gone :S

C[Wobble: so, something in atari here?
]
(;B[ad]
C[Becky: Oh yeah. Thanks.
]
(;W[bb]
C[Wobble: :)
Wobble: So like in chess, people tend to say atari when they are beginners and then stop later, so I'll say atari for now, and you should when you atari my pieces, so I know that you have noticed!

C[Becky: okidoke
Wobble: Atari!

C[Wobble: why did you go there?
Becky: Umm... I wasn't really sure what else to do. If I come over to your side, you will easily take me, so it seems like a waste of a move. So I figured, maybe I should spend my time strengthening my side - til I have something else to do.
Wobble: ok, fair enough
Becky: But I am open to suggestions and crticism!
Wobble: I think you have a weakness on the righthand side of the board - do you see where?
Becky: Oh yeah, you could take me in two moves.
Wobble: I know, I just wanted to know what you were thinking :) And strengthening probably sensible
Wobble: how?
Becky: Uhh... hmm. I guess you didn't just see that?
Wobble: no, I have seen it for a long time :)
Wobble: I'm checking that you've seen it correctly!
Becky: No, the white piece I put down at J3
Wobble: no, I haven't
Wobble: it feels like I'm playing with an old person who is not quite sure how technology works :P
Becky: Anyhoo. My plan for strenghthening was to make 'Tiger eyes'.
Becky: Hey!
Becky: There are lots of exciting buttons.
Becky: So I am clicking them.
Wobble: anyway, it's my go, so my question is how can I take you?
Becky: Oh, well you could go in H3 or J3, but I will try and take you first.
Wobble: If I go H3 what will happen?
Becky: Well... I won't go in J3, because then you'll go in J2 and take me. That would be sad. :(
]
(;W[hg]
C[Becky: Oh dear.
Wobble: so lets see what you will do :)
Wobble: also, I could have done the same thing on the left, except your move at b4 defended against it
Wobble: so that was a good move
]
(;B[hh]
(;W[ig]
C[Wobble: oh, I didn't say atari, but we had just talked about it
]
(;B[ih]
(;W[gc]
C[Becky: Why did you do that?
Wobble: also, are 'Tiger Eyes' different from eyes? I've never heard the phrase tiger eyes before
Becky: Umm... I guess they are probably the same thing.
Wobble: Because beginners don't like to be the first to pass, so when it reaches the end of the game I traditionally continue to make increasingly pointless moves until the beginner decides to pass
Wobble: this sometimems goes on for amusingly long
Becky: ... Is this a hint that I should pass?
Wobble: it depends if you think there is somewhere you should go
Wobble: there are no undecided boundaries left, so it depends if you think you can attack me somewhere, or if there is somewhere I can attack you that you should defend
Wobble: if you defend by putting a piece in your own territory for no reason then it will have cost you a point, but on the other hand, better safe than sorry...

C[Becky: :S What happened to the other piece you played? It's gone!
Wobble: what other piece/what new buttons have you been clicking?
Becky: Oh no I see.
Becky: Never mind.
Wobble: :)
Becky: Yay thanks. :)
Wobble: np

C[Wobble: what do you think of my pieces?
Wobble: alive, dead, unsure?
Becky: The ones you are placing now?
Wobble: yup
Becky: My first thought was that you were going for the big group around the row 5
Becky: Then I thought you were going for the two on row 3
Becky: which is why I changed my move
Wobble: ok
Becky: Now I wonder if you are just testing me...
Wobble: well, all 3 options are true!
Wobble: attacks are better if I'm doing more than one thing
]
(;B[cg]
C[Wobble: I either have to get two eyes, or kill one of your two groups
Wobble: so you need to stop me getting two eyes, and if one of your groups is in trouble maybe it should make eyes
Becky: What happens if I run out of time? (Unrelated to what we are talking about, just in general).

(;W[ch]
C[Wobble: oh, depends on the ruleset

(;B[eh]
C[Wobble: on kgs you can give your opponent more time
Wobble: not sure if I can here
]
(;W[dh]
C[Wobble: afterwards you will have 30seconds per move
]
(;B[df]
C[Wobble: and 5 lives
]
(;W[bh]
C[Wobble: that is what 5x30 means
Wobble: so you can play forever
]
(;B[di]
C[Becky: Then what do you mean by lives?
Wobble: so you have 30 seconds
Wobble: but if you overrun you have another 30 seconds, but you lose a life
Becky: OO
Wobble: when you have lost all 5 lives, then going over 30 seconds is fatal
Becky: *Oooh
Wobble: and you lose
Becky: okidoke

C[Wobble: I can pause the game by the looks of things
Wobble: ok
Wobble: I can do something nasty - do you see what?
Becky: Uh-oh; possibly, take my big blob in the middle
Wobble: how?
Becky: You didn't see that, did you? :(
Becky: So I will write it
Becky: You go in A4
Becky: Then I am sad
Wobble: yes, you will be
Becky: Because you will go in B5; or, if I go there, then you will go in A5
Wobble: oh, are you playing things out using analyze game?
Wobble: yes, correct, nice :)
Becky: No; that goes backwards. I played things out using Plan Conditional Moves.
Wobble: oh, do you know what Plan Conditional Moves does?
Wobble: it allows you to specifiy automatic responses
Wobble: so you can tell the program if I do something, to reply automatically

(;B[ae]
C[Wobble: which is probably what just happened?
Becky: Oh - yes
Wobble: :P
Becky: Ahhhh.... I seeee
Wobble: it's probably better to try and work the sequences out in your head
Wobble: rather than using a program to play them out
Becky: Sure. I was just clicking stuff because it's fun. :)
Wobble: yeah, I know :)

C[Wobble: and, sorry about your pieces :(

C[Wobble: atari
Wobble: do you know what a ko is?
]
(;B[bi]
C[Becky: Something I can't do?
Wobble: I like your guesswork
Wobble: kind of
Wobble: you see that if you took me at d1
Becky: hehe, ko could be 'kind of'
Wobble: I could retake you at e1
Becky: Oh, it means you just go in circles?
Wobble: ha, it could
Wobble: yes, it would be a loop
Becky: k
Wobble: so the rules of go forbid it
Wobble: and say you can't take back immediately in such a situation
Wobble: this is called a ko
Becky: Oh, so I can take back later?
Wobble: you can try playing somewhere else, and if it distracts me, you can then take back
Wobble: yes
Wobble: so if I take you at A1, you could then take me
Wobble: but I won't :)

(;B[fh]
C[Becky: Mm... I don't think there's much I can do...
Wobble: is your group in the bottom right alive?
Becky: I think so
Becky: I have eyes, maybe
Becky: sort of
Wobble: where are your eyes?
Becky: the holes
Wobble: which ones?
Wobble: is F2 an eye?
Becky: oh - I guess not, because if you go there you get E2
Wobble: is G1 an eye?
Becky: yes
Becky: you can't go there, because your piece would have no liberties
Wobble: what if I go f2 and take e2?
Becky: and wouldn't capture anything
Wobble: I could then take f1 at g2
Wobble: *take f1 at g1
Becky: oh yeah...
Wobble: for an eye in the corner or on the side, you need 'control' of all the surrounding squares
Becky: Oh, so it's all dead?
Wobble: you don't have control of f2
Wobble: well, let's pretend you didn't go at H9
Wobble: where might a good move be?
Becky: asdf
Becky: Oh it works!
Wobble: teehee
Wobble: having trouble?
Becky: Uh, maybe it's because I pulled my cable out
Becky: sorry
Wobble: no problem
Wobble: yes, that might have a negative effect on your internet!
Wobble: so...where might a good move be?
Becky: Uh, yeah. F2? Then I will actually have eyes?
Wobble: :)

C[Wobble: Ok, so we have to select any dead stones
Wobble: are there any that you think are dead?
Becky: Mine at B1
Wobble: yep
Wobble: that's the only one I think
Wobble: so you should select it
Wobble: yep
Wobble: and do accept removed stones
Wobble: cool
Wobble: thanks :)
Becky: :)
Wobble: hello again
Wobble: so you clicked start a review session, and then left I'm guessing?
Becky: oh - yes
Wobble: :)
Becky: But I'm guessing that by now you have also left, and won't see that
Becky:  - or not
Wobble: I don't run away as much as you :P
Wobble: Yeah, it put me in the review session with you
Becky: Hehe
Becky: Ooh, is that what you meant by 'gone walkies'?
Wobble: yes
Wobble: I sometimes wonder how much of what I say you don't understand but just file away until you later do :P
Wobble: like little puzzles to be solved
Wobble: do you fancy another game?
Becky: Uhh... yes. In general, I think I do file away and wait lots.
Becky: Sure
Wobble: 9x9 or 13x13? and would you prefer to play a game without a handicap where we talk lots about what to do? or where I give you more of a handicap and am more aggressive?
Wobble: ...makes me intrigued about what else you are waiting on
Becky: Oh oops I just went of it. :) I couldn't see how to get rid of the time, so I just made it very big. :) I will want to go to bed before it runs out!
Becky: *went for
