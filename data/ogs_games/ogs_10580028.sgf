integer: someone else in this tournament i forget who, ignored it and played an attach against my E3, i think that was a good move and hard for me to handle~

Darkshadious: haha

integer: website
Darkshadious: problems ;ibrary?
integer: goproblems.com or gochild2009
Darkshadious: Okay cool :))
Darkshadious: thank you!
integer: or get some app for mobile / tablet for when on bus/waiting places etc
Darkshadious: I have gobooks
Darkshadious: app
Darkshadious: I have 3 books that Im reading
integer: which ones?
Darkshadious: the fundamentals of go by yuling yang or something. Life and death by james davies and tesuji by him aswell
Darkshadious: Yilun yang*
Darkshadious: fundamental principles of go
integer: i have some chinese go books. to give you an example of how differently they think about it: one book is 1000 problems, graded 30 kyu to 1d, starting with problems like "count the liberties of this the white groups" to give you an idea. it doesn't talk at all about opening or joseki until 5kyu++. just pure problems and patterns until that.
Darkshadious: whoa weird
Darkshadious: I guess thats smart
integer: whereas you often see 5kyu amateurs in the west study joseki or subtle opening stuff, which i personally don't think does much. but i mean as long as it's fun
Darkshadious: yeah 
Darkshadious: I mean using opening fuseki for amatures is sad because I dont know what they are supposed to do lol
integer: nearly all games are lost or won due to tactics
Darkshadious: true
Darkshadious: or the bigger picture in 19x19
Darkshadious: I watch a lot of youtube go videos but theyre so long
integer: white finds a tesuji to connect his stones, suddenly two weak groups become strong, which is a huge swing, and suddenly the difference between a 3-space or 5-space extension, a high or low approach etc doesn't matter much
integer: stuff like that
Darkshadious: yeah I agree
Darkshadious: Care for a game of 19x19
Darkshadious: ?
integer: sure, if you want
Darkshadious: It can be quick
integer: whatever time controls you want
Darkshadious: And you can choose the settings :)
Darkshadious: lol
integer: watching starcraft 2 tournament on other monitor
