C[rafar: I'm not good at 9x9, especially with handicap.. Do you have 9 stones handicap ganes too with this tournamenet? I have a few, this is crazy

(;W[fg]
C[rberenguel: I just resigned them... The handicap is clearly wrong, I'm giving 6 in another game that I'll take as a test to see if I can make a living group :S

C[rafar: yeah I might do the same, I heard that 5 is way enough in a 9x9, between a 4d and a first time beginner, the 4d told me that, sooooo...

C[rberenguel: Yeah, maximum handicap in 9x9 is 5 stones, anything more should be komi changes

C[rafar: By the way on the tournamenet page it says "no handicap", what the f***
rberenguel: That, too :D Anyway, I think this tournament should be cancelled: the 30k can win easily :D:D

C[rafar: thanks, bye bye!
rberenguel: if you had defended earlier it would have been a tough game, I'd get no territory... See you soon!
rafar: I thought for a moment that I could kill your group, then I realised you could connect in the upper right ^^
rberenguel: 9x9 strategy: spread some stones then fight as crazy ;)
rberenguel: but I'm not specially good at 9x9, so I guess it's harder than this
rafar: me neither so thanks for the advice, I'll apply it! bye
