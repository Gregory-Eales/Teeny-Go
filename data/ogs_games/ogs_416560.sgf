C[JeansebL: thanks :)
Strategist: Thanks for the game.
JeansebL: it's good to see people playing live games :)
JeansebL: we have to reverse that trend of only correspondence games :p
Strategist: Here I play only 9x9 live.
Strategist: 19x19 I play on IGS.
JeansebL: Why not here ?
JeansebL: it works just as well :p
Strategist: I mostly use OGS for correspondence.
Strategist: I don't know.
Strategist: Im just used to playing on IGS.
JeansebL: hehe, try it when you have time :) In full screen (with the f11 key) the board is better than on igs ^^
JeansebL: anyway, see you later :)
Strategist: See you.
