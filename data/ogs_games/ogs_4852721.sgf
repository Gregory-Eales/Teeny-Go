C[mgeorg: not good at life and death with the timer
Real Clock: just try to drag it till the last second and time will seem longer :)
Real Clock: btw, why are you playing fast games if you dont like it?
mgeorg: I don't usually end up in games where I actually need to think about it.  I end up waiting for 20kyus to make silly moves after thinking about them forever :P
mgeorg: Of course, you'd say the same of me, I'm sure :)
