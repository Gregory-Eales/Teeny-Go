C[nomadfarmer: I don't *think* there's anything tricky there :o)
nomadfarmer: how did you get in to playing go?
rafar: that's what I was desperately looking forc :)
rafar: for*
rafar: I began playing 3 years ago but I don't precisely rememer how
nomadfarmer: hehe
rafar: I know I read a news article about the game, 
rafar: I was already curious, maybe 2 years before that I tried playing with a computer and didn't understand the game right away so i quitted, then after the news article I found a tutorial on the web, and I got hooked ^^ and you?

C[nomadfarmer: Hmm
nomadfarmer: Interesting question here.
rafar: can I get out of the seki, and at what cost
nomadfarmer: I kind of think that me actually killing the upper group is bigger than this group changing from seki to alive.
rafar: it seems so
rafar: if I don't try to make both live I lose anyway
