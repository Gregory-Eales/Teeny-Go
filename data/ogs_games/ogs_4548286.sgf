C[DragonStone: You nromally want to start in a corner
DragonStone: good :)
]
;B[cc]
C[DragonStone: good :)

(;W[gg]
C[reinsor: another corner?
DragonStone: yep
]
(;B[cg]
(;W[gc]
C[reinsor: center?
DragonStone: at this point you have can either invade or enlarge
DragonStone: e5 is okay as well
]
(;B[ee]
C[DragonStone: im going to invade you now by going here. The point of this is to reduce your territory
]
(;W[ce]
C[DragonStone: now you got to try your best to capture it
DragonStone: because if you don't you will lose a lot of points
reinsor: ah, and then I will use that space...
]
(;B[be]
C[reinsor: reducing my territory etc
reinsor: indeed
DragonStone: hmm, that was a bit weak but thats okay, you nromally want to attack from above pusing me into the side 
DragonStone: like d6 for example would have been nice
]
(;W[cf]
C[reinsor: not c6?
]
(;B[cd]
C[DragonStone: thats okay as well, but this is why its a bit weak.. i can go over here to escape
]
(;W[df]
C[reinsor: is e3 good?
DragonStone: no
DragonStone: because if you go there, i can push out and make more weaknesses in your stones
reinsor: hmmm, then I would say e4
DragonStone: i think d3 is better because it makes points at the same time t the bottom
DragonStone: e4 dosent make terriory it just attacks
reinsor: but it makes connecting with g3 easier

C[DragonStone: good defense :)
]
(;W[ec]
C[DragonStone: nows your cahnce to attack my 4 stones, because i carelessy did not think about them :)
]
(;B[ef]
C[DragonStone: nice
]
(;W[bg]
(;B[bh]
C[reinsor: thank you 
DragonStone: dont forget to count the liberties of the stones, good way to check if they are weak or not
]
(;W[ah]
(;B[ch]
(;W[eg]
(;B[fg]
(;W[eh]
(;B[fh]
C[reinsor: you lost these two, right?
DragonStone: in this case my two stones have two liberties while your 4 stones have 3, so i cannot win this capturing race
DragonStone: correct :)

(;W[ci]
C[DragonStone: you are one stone ahead of me

(;B[dh]
C[DragonStone: okay now you got the left corner, its time to move on to other places
DragonStone: im going to defend the right corner by going here
]
(;W[gf]
C[DragonStone: you can sneak and steal points by h2
DragonStone: or you can play agressive by going at f8
DragonStone: its kind of higher thinking sorry..
DragonStone: you can go to usgo.org or gobase.org to learn more about go
reinsor: yes, but that's only about influence mostly, right?
reinsor: okay, I will look that up, thank you
DragonStone: influence moves are noramlly towards the center at the beginning of the game, to build a big center  
reinsor: what about f4?
DragonStone: f8 and h2 are moves to steal points from your penitent since they are so close to the side
reinsor: aha
DragonStone: f4 is not a good move because it dosent make territory or steal your opponent's territory 
DragonStone: it just connects your stones
reinsor: but it also threatens your white stones
]
(;B[hh]
C[DragonStone: yes, but the attack stops when i defend at g5
DragonStone: which makes territory at the same time, so its really pointless and you gain nothing
]
(;W[gh]
(;B[hg]
C[reinsor: what about g5 later?
]
(;W[gi]
(;B[hf]
C[DragonStone: g5 is definitely a vital move since your two stones are on the verge of being killed 
DragonStone: g4 is good as well
]
(;W[ge]
C[DragonStone: kepp extending those stones to make more space to live
reinsor: should I do h5 to make enough room for two eyes?
]
(;B[he]
(;W[hd]
C[DragonStone: there are two choices now
DragonStone: j5 or h1
DragonStone: one of them is the correct way to live
reinsor: h1
]
(;B[hi]
C[DragonStone: now im sneaking in to try to steal your life space...
]
(;W[ie]
C[DragonStone: now you have to defend if you want to live
reinsor: j2 or j4....
reinsor: I think j4
DragonStone: lol, those stones are dead, but since this is a teaching game i will let them live :)
DragonStone: yep, go at j4
]
(;B[if]
(;W[id]
C[reinsor: you should have done j2, right?
DragonStone: right
reinsor: since the other would be a false eye
]
(;B[ih]
C[reinsor: well, thanks
reinsor: :)
DragonStone: now we are at the yose stage, which means securing your territories
]
(;W[da]
C[reinsor: you get the upper right corner?
reinsor: yes... would be hopeless for me there
]
(;B[de]
C[DragonStone: d9 secures my top group and also threatens to sneak into your top left group, so the best move to counter that will be either c8 or d8
reinsor: ah
DragonStone: c9 wont work because i can atari that stone
DragonStone: i can sneak in, for example..
]
(;W[bb]
C[reinsor: of course, there's no need to get your stones when they're already dead..
DragonStone: even though i cant save them, i can still reduce your points :)

C[reinsor: do I have any chance at invading or attacking (e9,8 etc)?
]
(;B[ac]
C[DragonStone: you can try to attack at f8 if thats what you mean, but i can block at f7, ithere are too many stones surrounding your one stone for it to kill my group
reinsor: I should invade the upper right anyway to minimalise your gain there

(;B[eh]
C[DragonStone: every corner is now secured, when you can reduce or invade, the game is over
DragonStone: you cant*
]
(;W[]
C[reinsor: why, because if I would play there, you would have to use more stones and thus lose territory
reinsor: so you should get less points than when you end it beforehand
DragonStone: i have to go soon, but i going to upload the review game and show you why that move is pointless
DragonStone: \[object Object\]
reinsor: Okay, thank you for the teaching
