C[leandros: ah!
othafa: quite the game. i've never done that before.
othafa: thank you for playing!
leandros: what?
othafa: killed all my opponents stones
leandros: yes because you are an unfair player!
othafa: wait, why?
othafa: i'm sorry, if you feel i've treated you unfairly
leandros: I was not so bad at all.
othafa: i agree, you played well
leandros: I feel totrally debased. There was no need to play C2 at that stage of game!
leandros: Can I ask which country you come from?
othafa: i disagree. i always appreciate it when people play moves like that. i would rather have a weakness revealed so that I don't play like that again in the future.
othafa: USA
leandros: aha
othafa: I do apologize. if I encounter you again, i will tie up play once it's clear i've won
othafa: Sorry, does the idiom "tie up" translate? I mean finish quickly.
leandros: When a Japanese has already won a game he never debasese his opponent. It is "law" in Japan, that even the losser has to keep his pride.
leandros: But all  Estern European and most US and European players do not have any knowledge of japanese politeness in Go. Sorry to say this.
othafa: If you want to talk about breaches in etiqette, you should learn western customs. it was very rude of you not to thank me for the game, regardless of how it turned out for you. have a nice day. http://www.britgo.org/bgj/02009.html
leandros: HÃ¤, I have not finished the conversation and how you know I would not thank you.
