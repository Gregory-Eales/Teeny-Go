C[jincho: Not sure, I am already in 5 other correspondence tournaments. One of them (the teaching tournament) is 13x13 with handicap
HikaruTim: No problem!  Don't overload yourself.  However, this tournament is "live" so quite different than correspondence.

C[jincho: yeah, having 2 weak groups i hard. If you want we can review the game
HikaruTim: I have never reviewed a game before, how do you do that?

C[HikaruTim: OK, I can't see any way to save the top group.  :-(

C[HikaruTim: Actually, maybe I should have said "no way to keep alive with space".
HikaruTim: How is the top left scored now?  Everything zero?
jincho: no, the top left is dead, sorry
jincho: you can not kill my 2 stones, but I can kill your group whenever I want
jincho: http://senseis.xmp.net/?BentFourInTheCorner
jincho: here you can read about this shape
jincho: if you have questions, please ask

C[jincho: I can give you a review if you want?
jincho: for review we should be both online at the same time
jincho: just send me a message when you are here and see me online

C[jincho: You asked in a private message why this top left is dead
jincho: if you want I can show you in review
jincho: but here the short version:
jincho: you can not kill B9 and A8
jincho: I can first remove all ko threats on the board
jincho: than at any time I can connect at A9 and after that play C9 or A7
jincho: this results in the „bent 4“ shape about which I sent you the link
jincho: „bent 4“ can give you a ko, but it is a ko in which I take first and you have to assume that there are no more ko threats on the board
jincho: so I win the ko and the corner is dead
jincho: if you want we can play this out
jincho: but japanese rules also say that „bent 4“ is dead by definition
jincho: also I am even ahead without killing this corner
