Cloverr: I think you might have won without those H1-H4 stones
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: h2
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: instead of e4
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: i was considering h2
Cloverr: YEah
Cloverr: that would have been better
Cloverr: but top went so badly for me that I had to try something
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: g2
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: g2 ruins your life here
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: as move 23
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: ah well
Cloverr: Yeah. I lose too much points
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: and you can't capture
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: safe and invasive
6.022 140 857(74) × 10²³: bye bye
