metaphysician splurgist :): opponent was 12k
metaphysician splurgist :): he pnbished me hard

metaphysician splurgist :): yes^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i know but
metaphysician splurgist :): i kinda dont like the
metaphysician splurgist :): passive spirit :)
spatula: ??
metaphysician splurgist :): i mean
metaphysician splurgist :): its a lot territory focused
metaphysician splurgist :): local fights dont have much impact ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): also
metaphysician splurgist :): https://online-go.com/game/10587569
metaphysician splurgist :): i found it ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): the game i won form nothing :)
spatula: Not really thoug
metaphysician splurgist :): bets moment start at move 150 or sometihng ^^

metaphysician splurgist :): yes ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): i'm a big fighter as i said :)
metaphysician splurgist :): so 19x19 is kinda boring ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): atm at least :)
metaphysician splurgist :): btw i linked the game i mentionned ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): if you are curious
spatula: I play 9 by 9 cuz 19 by 19 is too exciting 
metaphysician splurgist :): lool
metaphysician splurgist :): sounds like contradiciton ^^
metaphysician splurgist :): so
metaphysician splurgist :): maybe
metaphysician splurgist :): there are 2 sides to it
metaphysician splurgist :): 1) you need to be more skilled to enjoy more complex stuff
metaphysician splurgist :): 2) depending on personality, you may be more attracted to local fights ^^

Enumaris: bloody
Enumaris: kind of unreasonable to want your opponent to self-atari
Enumaris: just make your opponent insert moves on a computer
Enumaris: instead of a real board
Enumaris: it doesn't lead to anything
Enumaris: might be a seki or something
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: giant dumpling to avoid ko
Enumaris: that's funky
Enumaris: 9x9 too small
Enumaris: play 19x19
Enumaris: it's better
Enumaris: always ready
Enumaris: just
Enumaris: if ur opponent places a stone on the board
Enumaris: try to kill it
Enumaris: FIGHT
