C[AdorkableOVO: i understand you play 1 move each day to maintain on 5th place, but for this match even you lose you won't drop any in ladder, so please be quick if you can

C[andrewLsmith84: I should probably pay attention more to the meta-strategy regarding summiting the Go ladder, but I don't. I recognize now that one will have to beat the #1 player BEFORE the other challengers in order to take the spot. But, I just don't have time for it.
andrewLsmith84: You see, I don't move slow intentionally to hold my rank. I just have always played 1 move per day. I do that with my other games as well. Its my break from work/life, and keeps my skills decent. (And then I eventually review the games, which maybe helps me improve). Anyways, sorry for going slow, but this is all I have time for. In my defense, I've climbed to #2, so it kinda works, right? Anyways, I'm mostly interested in playing some of the other strong 9x9 players online, such as yourself :-)
