C[mft0: I haven't given up on this one yet. I also think I can still make it, but only If I use the analyse to ensure I don't do something stupid : D

C[mft0: Why did you play E8 instead of E9?
fishku: because of H9, the whole thing can turn into a ko:
fishku: F9 E9 E8 G9 is a ko where white can't gain much, but can lose a lot
fishku: so it's usually better to avoid the ko :)
fishku: yet another situation in this side pattern, just when you thought you had it figured out ;)
fishku: BTW we are gonna see the avoidance of the ko in the next few moves
fishku: black can push once more now
