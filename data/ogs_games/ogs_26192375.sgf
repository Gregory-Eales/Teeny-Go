C[Bradicalman: How so?

(;W[hd]
C[Bradicalman: What was the proper move as well?
He Who Walks in Shadows: Too defensive. Gives you a change to extend to c3.  B would be behind about 5 pts to win.  Proper is D3.

C[He Who Walks in Shadows: That was a mistake.
Bradicalman: My move or yours?
He Who Walks in Shadows: Yours.
Bradicalman: Why?
He Who Walks in Shadows: D9.  The monkey jump would be better. Reduces me.  
He Who Walks in Shadows: If I count right, I have a 5pt lead, you need to reduce it.

C[He Who Walks in Shadows: f8 fixes my error.
Bradicalman: But isn't there the risk you take the 4 cluster of stones? Or do I have too many liberties for you to take?

C[He Who Walks in Shadows: If I play g2, you could have played at h2.  I have a libery shortage in the corner.
