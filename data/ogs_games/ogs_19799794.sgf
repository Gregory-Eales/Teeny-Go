C[nwurd: well, I considered resigning, as I have the feeling the game is already hopeless... but I wonder if there's still somthing to do for white...? :-)

C[nwurd: well, that's hopeless (for a while though!). Would you be kind enough to review at least the first moves, and how white could have played not to end up like this? :)
