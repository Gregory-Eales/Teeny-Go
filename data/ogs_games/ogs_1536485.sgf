C[Ornable: so i want to avoid being the guy that just plays too well and is frustrating to play against
MJH: No no this is good
Ornable: alright

Ornable: just let me know
MJH: If not I'm just going to play e7
Ornable: alright
MJH: Nah, I come to you for a challenge and to learn

C[Ornable: and he says punishing people mistakes were unfavorable to them
MJH: Really/
Ornable: yea
MJH: You would think you should punish their mistakes
MJH: So they recognize it as a mistake
Ornable: thats what i think too
MJH: and don't make it in a game
Ornable: but people don't like it
MJH: no no
MJH: please punish my mistakes, lol
Ornable: alright lol
MJH: I want to learn from them
Ornable: but sometimes it's a question for myself too
Ornable: whether i can punish or not
MJH: true true
Ornable: because i'm not a professional
Ornable: so any punishments that go successful is useful sometimes

C[Ornable: usually if i dont' comment on a move
Ornable: it's mostly because i'm not 100% sure
MJH: that's cool

Ornable: either that or it's an okay move
MJH: Just trying to see if I can make life in the bottom left
