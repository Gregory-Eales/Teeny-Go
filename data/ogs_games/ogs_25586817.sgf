C[thomasijontichy: don't have any ways to continue enough you D7 now and you can reduce either way so
mark5000: I said the right move is hard to find. It's actually E3.
thomasijontichy: oh
thomasijontichy: yes I think I see it
mark5000: \[object Object\]
mark5000: I don't remember exactly, but it's a better shot
thomasijontichy: well it's got more going for it
thomasijontichy: threats at G3 C3 etc etc
mark5000: Right
mark5000: I feel like I trapped you.
mark5000: A little dirty.

thomasijontichy: hmm one last maybe
thomasijontichy: or u no time
thomasijontichy: or rather maybe bored hehe
mark5000: Your method of play isn't bad though. Sadly on 9x9 there isn't much in the way of general concepts. It's pure fighting.
thomasijontichy: yup
mark5000: I can afford one more.
mark5000: Let me grab a lunch real quick. Go ahead and challenge.
