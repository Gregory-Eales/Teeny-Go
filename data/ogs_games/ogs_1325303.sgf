C[rpablo007: good game
Sachi: Thank you for the game
Sachi: ^_^
rpablo007: actually you did right up there
Sachi: Yeah, upper left was good.
Sachi: I might have focused more on lower left thickness earlier, too, because invading me wasn't working out
Sachi: But I'm more defensive, and it gets me caught out. You did fine.
Sachi: gg :3
rpablo007: yeah
rpablo007: good luck
