Zwergesel: +d
la_mudri: That was fun!
Zwergesel: proper tournament final result :D
Zwergesel: gotta go now, bye
la_mudri: Bye. See you around!
la_mudri: At F2, I thought I'd lost.
la_mudri: Yes. I had D8 to go at as well.
la_mudri: I didn't think there was anything special.
la_mudri: \[object Object\]
la_mudri: Where are you, Elom?
la_mudri: You said “where would white play now”. From what position?
la_mudri: What move number?
la_mudri: Ah, where I broke the joseki!
la_mudri: I'd play F4, I think.
la_mudri: Maybe F3, setting up for a bottom-left invasion.
la_mudri: \[object Object\]
la_mudri: Got to go. Bye for now.
Elom: Down to the wire! :)
Elom: I think you were slightly ahead before F2.
Elom: And, you had sente afterwards, so...
Elom: White managed to come back into the game after a difficult opening, but...
Elom: your endgame was good...
Elom: Well, I think that maybe white unprepared for this move.
Elom: where would you play now as white, anyone?
Elom: If you mean which country, Britain (as shown on the spectator list
Elom: Here, I'm just wondering about others ideas.
Elom: (I've talked too much already :) )
Elom: 7
Elom: Yep!
bananasplit: i would of done the same move
Elom: I'm a little aggressive, so... 
Elom: It's a little risky, but
Elom: Playable I guess
bananasplit: ya F3 was a good move
Elom: White has to look after two groups, but the two groups aren't so weak
Elom: If white can live here, then yes.
Elom: Hmm, maybe...
Elom: Black is winning like this
Elom: But, I don't think it's necessary for white to
Elom: sacrifice...
Elom: OK, bye :)
Elom: I have to go too.
