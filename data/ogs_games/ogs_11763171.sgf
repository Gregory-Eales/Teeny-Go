C[reedn: ty
reedn: gg
froofy: gg
froofy: I got lucky on left.
froofy: I didn't mean to go a4, I was trying a3.
reedn: oh, i thouth it was a pro move, but it worked anyhow
froofy: Yeah, it surprised me.  Now I need to try to remember it so I can try to use it someday.
reedn: and i was losing anyway
froofy: Usually my luck is in the opposite direction.
froofy: All of a sudden 20 stones disappear.
reedn: haha
reedn: pass 15k is horrible
froofy: Of course I've had it happen for the good too, but very rarely.  I make a a move and a bunch of my opponent's stones disappear, and I didn't even realize they were in atari.
reedn: i dont think im 13... i must practice more, and you were my strogest opponent on this site
froofy: That's how much I pay attention.
froofy: You did pretty good, but with more time you would have done better, I think.
reedn: yup, it gets wierd when thing heat up
reedn: and cutting stone is a hard concept
froofy: I like it, the freaking out part.  Makes it more exciting.
reedn: i learned a lot from this game, thanks
reedn: see you around
froofy: I didn't know the interval time, 10 seconds is a fair bit of time for a few calculations, so I should have slowed down.
froofy: Ha, don't judge off my games, not sure I'm one to look at.
froofy: If you try 5 sec blitz, you can't second guess, or you'll time out.  Once you make up your mind, that's almost it.
froofy: You want a go at one?
reedn: it sounds freaking 5sec blitz
reedn: ok
