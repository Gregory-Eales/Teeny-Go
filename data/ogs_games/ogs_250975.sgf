C[KlausP: I thin this is the loosing move. White must take the Ko.
Rena: Hmm, I think I'd read that as well! I'd decided at one point (after reading everything a few moves back from here) that I'd won, but then when I came to play later I didn't re-read and just misremembered the sequence... Interesting game anyway.
