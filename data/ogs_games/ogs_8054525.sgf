C[froofy: I usually use 5-5, but I'm not strong enough to use it properly, so I'm doing 3-4, seems more suited to my level.

C[froofy: Not much, really.
sipejo: well, congrats!
froofy: Just to force you to take before going to a1, but you took immediately anyway.
froofy: gg
froofy: I was worried that game, I made one mistake that you could have jumped on.
froofy: Well, many I think, but one bad one.
sipejo: Well, guess I ended up making more mistakes ;)
sipejo: so what was your bad mistake?
froofy: e8, I should have played g8.
froofy: If you play g8 after I play e8, I'm dead.
sipejo: I see.
sipejo: \[object Object\]
froofy: I guess I do get some territory around b7 in compensation, but you get around h7 area.
sipejo: True.. was worries about the survival of my big group
sipejo: I don't play out enough in my mind.
sipejo: How should i answer A3
sipejo: got me kinda off guard
froofy: I'm not sure exactly.
froofy: It's in a corner, so it's tougher.
sipejo: hey, i finish work, gotta go home
sipejo: :D
froofy: If one person is one space closer to the edge than the other, you can do a knight's jump or big knight's jump and still be safe.  It's more of mid~end game stuff.
sipejo: play another time
froofy: Okay, thanks, see you.
sipejo: oh..  didnt know that
