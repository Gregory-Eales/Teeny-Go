gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Oops, there seem to be some problems with the display of the variations?
gamesorry: I finally find where to review the game... you could find it at http://online-go.com/review/31017
ST000MA: now: variation Could be better for black
ST000MA: H2 should have same purpose (i tried to force you defend that group) but C3 would do the same ad it takes much more territory?
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Yeah I think it'd be slightly better
ST000MA: why is F6 bad shape?
gamesorry: It's because black has an iron wall in the middle, and F6 is too close to the wall to be effective
ST000MA: iron wall?
ST000MA: but ok, i understand the point...
gamesorry: Just a metaphor;) black has many connected stones in the middle...
ST000MA: yeah that is usualy pretty strong and useful. but i didnt use it as well as i could
ST000MA: about move 9
ST000MA: should i play G2 and keep my formation solid?
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Playing g2 is just another variation, which would end up with something like this:
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: white can't play f4 in response
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: why is black better in variation 2?
ST000MA: ok, its just score estimating, black has better influence
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: yeah in 3 black has to continue with D3 i guess?
gamesorry: Yeah, it variation 2 black can further capture h4
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Right
gamesorry: So maybe black has to:
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: after ...this...
ST000MA: what should white play?
ST000MA: H2 or E8?
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: wow
gamesorry: e8 is bigger I think, but d6 could also be threatening
ST000MA: e8 in move 18?
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: D6 in move 18 is actually very good for white?
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: no i think black wins by 0.5
ST000MA: no, 1.5
gamesorry: d6 will pose some threatens, but not necessarily the best move
gamesorry: Hmm... white has two prisoners, did you count that?
ST000MA: yeah...
ST000MA: another way to count it
ST000MA: on midline there are 5 white 4 black stones so white is +1
ST000MA: white has 2 stones on blacks side so its +4
ST000MA: with komi its white +10.5, but black has 6 stones on whites side it is +12
ST000MA: B+1.5 (it should be counted forced moves and who got the last move, assume white plays J1 it is counted well)
ST000MA: um, what variation are we takling aboyt?
gamesorry: Oh, I assumed the wrong komi..
gamesorry: it's 5.5 instead of 7.5...
ST000MA: yeah japaniese rules
ST000MA: 7.5 in theresting komi
gamesorry: Yep, so e8 might not be enough for white
gamesorry: d6 doesn't work as well actually
ST000MA: that is move 18. what if white plays E4 then black D4 then white D6
ST000MA: no, not good variation...
ST000MA: ok, lets see what happens with D6 in move 18
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: the point of playing this
ST000MA: is to make double threath to brake in, right?
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: hmm, so black wins again.
gamesorry: Yeah, in that case
ST000MA: why? o.O i thought it is meaningless variation (sometimes such things can happen ^^)
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Perhaps only if black plays some wrong move..
gamesorry: c7 is big
ST000MA: so that is how i should play (i would probably lose again thugh ^^)
gamesorry: and f4 isn't strong enough
ST000MA: yeah but D8 is also very important
ST000MA: i think...
gamesorry: Yep, at least there'd be better chance for black;)
ST000MA: because whole 8-line is empty
gamesorry: right
ST000MA: well, this was great review. Thank you very much, i appreciate it!
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Just to make it less obvious;)
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Right;)
ST000MA: this is great. it will help a lot for learn go week lecture
gamesorry: Thank you:) I'm still trying to figure out the tsumego in the last variation;)
ST000MA: what is tsumego?
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Oh it's a term describing life and death: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tsumego
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: indeed...
ST000MA: then D4 is not good
gamesorry: right, perhaps even e1...
ST000MA: but if blck does not play D4 then white gets another eye on D3, so lets figure out how to kill it
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: you are right, but if black plays D4 in move 21?
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: white cant live here
ST000MA: CAN*
gamesorry: due to the threat at d4
ST000MA: so this isnt killable shape after all...
ST000MA: yeah...
ST000MA: usualy it is easy killed with E1
gamesorry: right, if black is solidly connected by d5 then white should be killable
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: yeah...
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: nice!
gamesorry: Hmm... tons of variations, I didn't expect so many;)
ST000MA: yeah it is very interesting!
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
ST000MA: yes
ST000MA: you dont mind if i use some of these variations for lecture for learn go week? ill put your name as for creator of course
gamesorry: \[object Object\]
gamesorry: Sure feel free to use these, although some of them might not be correct;)
ST000MA: well i have 2 weeks to fix everything, but i think we (you) have analyzed this very good
gamesorry: Thank you! I've never analyze a game so detailedly, especially in English, but It turns out to be sort of addicting;)
ST000MA: it is! I love analyzing 9x9 board! maybe we could show this review to other lpayers it would be very useful :0
ST000MA: :)
ST000MA: 0 -> )
ST000MA: and it will definitely help a lot for LGW
gamesorry: Absolutely! :-D
ST000MA: i will start preparing those lectures now.. See you, and thanks a lot for the game and review!!! :D
ST000MA: and good luck for Meijin! ;)
gamesorry: Sounds great! Thank you and good luck to you too!
ST000MA: thanks! see you!
gamesorry: See you:)
