C[Bradicalman: I messed up
Kosh: I fear granting this undo may be my big mistake of the game. But it's the more fun option as AdamR would say.
Bradicalman: but seriously thank you so much
Kosh: \[object Object\]
Kosh: The ko threat at G3 was good. I think you needed to pursue it when I ignored it.

C[Kosh: There are a couple of extra variations in the malkovich log for you to look at after the game if you want.

C[Kosh: 'that?' malkovich log? Chat that won't become visible to your opponent until the game has ended. Like spectators comments.

C[Kosh: The 2x2 shape that you were left with after move 46 is dead as it stands so long as the surrounding (black) stones are secure.
Kosh: All Black has to do is play diagonally opposite when White plays internally, to prevent two eyes.

C[Bradicalman: Yeah I know about it I've been playing for close to a year. I just have to play there because it's like if I don't I automatically lose so might as well
