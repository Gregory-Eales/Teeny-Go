C[KyuT: I personally haven't had much luck with this move and I'm usually happy as black to get E7 here.

C[KyuT: I play C3 (or D3) here as White. I'm not sure it's better but I don't like the game for White after the F3/D3 exchange. Black's stones seem to be making a good shape and partitioning the board in just over their fair share (komi doesn't quite compensate for the weakness of the White shape). 9x9 openings are hard though but I'm pretty comfortable as Black in this position.

C[KyuT: There's always crazy stuff you can try in go. I'm not 100% sure what happens if you play D2 here and some weird moves on the left might set up a way to squeeze out an extra endgame point or two (which is probably all you need). It seems dangerous to let black solidify so easily with D2 as Black already has more than half the board.

C[KyuT: After this point I think you've lost. I couldn't see much you can try and I can win without having to fight over the endgame.
