C[MrZNF: huh, that was a missclick :( Was losing anyhow though. Had a hallucination that j2 was working somehow, though it clearly isn't. Without the exchange maybe I could've made something happen with h2 at some point. Now it's just hopeless. Well played!
dr.toma: thx
dr.toma: G1H2/E2D2/E1 can live
dr.toma: but big damage on upper left
