C[SlimeSloth: I am trying to block your left wing
SlimeSloth: from connecting
SlimeSloth: u just need to keep ur pieces alive
scaredycat: And the right side was never really safe.
scaredycat: Or even close.
scaredycat: But I felt I needed to do something.
SlimeSloth: yes
SlimeSloth: so in this situation
SlimeSloth: the best counter for the block stratigy is to copy
SlimeSloth: annoying as it is
scaredycat: To play mirror go?
SlimeSloth: for the first couple of moves at least
scaredycat: So I should start c7?
SlimeSloth: yes
SlimeSloth: mirroring like opposite corner 
SlimeSloth: not exact opposite
scaredycat: So then you proceed to get 2 corners and tengen, can I win against that?
SlimeSloth: try another game?
scaredycat: Sure.
