C[SaroVati: gg
SaroVati: was expecting a 5 minute game
SaroVati: since you are higher ranked
SaroVati: but didnt expect you to read so much for a 9x9 against a lower kyu :P

C[SaroVati: im glad
SaroVati: you made sure
SaroVati: to count out the 10 endgame moves though :)
SaroVati: good game!
hermitage171: you know that there's a resign button, right?
SaroVati: ty for the game

C[SaroVati: i  had a 1% chance of winning
SaroVati: if you kept your trend of taking forever to make a move to time out
SaroVati: so I was banking on it!
SaroVati: thanks for the game bud
hermitage171: are you kidding? you were just a half point away
SaroVati: yes
SaroVati: that is countable
SaroVati: hence why I said
SaroVati: if you take that group
SaroVati: you win
SaroVati: so just get it over with
SaroVati: xD
SaroVati: I wasnt kidding
hermitage171: so resign then
SaroVati: why?
SaroVati: kyu players are prone to make terrible mistakes
SaroVati: and time might even factor in
SaroVati: i dont need to think anymore for my moves
SaroVati: I already know what order they should be played
SaroVati: its about a 5 click difference in effort
SaroVati: to me that's worth sticking around and finishing my lunch
hermitage171: oh never mind. you're weird. and this game has a ten second increment, so I wasn't going to time out.
SaroVati: ah
SaroVati: the illogical
SaroVati: "I cant give you an argument so I will attack your person" type of route
SaroVati: cant say I'm surprised :)
SaroVati: good game man
SaroVati: have a great day
hermitage171: what an odd fellow you are
