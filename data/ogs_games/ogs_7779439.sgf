jmdingess: :)
jmdingess: good game
jmdingess: \[object Object\]
dondavid: for you or for me?
jmdingess: for me
dondavid: oh yeah
dondavid: i couldn't tell what was gonna happen there
dondavid: though obviously my reading for what i did do wasn't any better
jmdingess: \[object Object\]
jmdingess: \[object Object\]
dondavid: \[object Object\]
dondavid: i thought you'd start with that
jmdingess: \[object Object\]
jmdingess: \[object Object\]
dondavid: agh
dondavid: haha gonna take me like 10 minutes to look at all these :)
jmdingess: haha
jmdingess: thats why I said
jmdingess: not convinced
jmdingess: because I wasnt sure
jmdingess: didnt read it all until just now
jmdingess: just didn'tlook promising
dondavid: think i shoulda just stepped back one move early probably
dondavid: \[object Object\]
dondavid: or some such
jmdingess: \[object Object\]
jmdingess: even from there white is comfortably ahead
dondavid: oh
dondavid: i also suck at counting
dondavid: btw
jmdingess: hehe wlel
dondavid: in-game at least
jmdingess: its easy for 9x9
jmdingess: just
jmdingess: as long as white gets a good sized area
jmdingess: or makes two living groups
jmdingess: assume they win
jmdingess: haha
jmdingess: because of komi
dondavid: hmm, against lower kyu players i usually split em into a couple groups and squish em down real small
jmdingess: yeahh- easier to kill then live on 9x9
jmdingess: completely the opposite from 19x
dondavid: i pretty much only play 9x9
dondavid: i have no idea what to do on 19x!
jmdingess: I played only 9x9 until around 15k
jmdingess: then I started playing 19x and shot right up to 18k
jmdingess: haha
dondavid: how did you get to  7k?
jmdingess: played a lot
jmdingess: im usually 6k just got deranked e .e
dondavid: hmm
jmdingess: uh
jmdingess: I do a lot of tsumego
jmdingess: but
jmdingess: its just goproblems and online-go
jmdingess: some videos on youtube helped
jmdingess: but its mainly those two
dondavid: i got a few kyu better when i started thinking in terms of cutting/connecting instead of just territory
dondavid: but i assume there must be some other key concepts waiting out there to be grasped
jmdingess: haha
jmdingess: well
jmdingess: it doesnt really exist in 9x9
jmdingess: but theres the idea of influence
jmdingess: and building moyos will give you a headache when you switch over
jmdingess: oh god and all the opening move theory will drive you insane
jmdingess: but
jmdingess: its a lot of fun
dondavid: ooh, influence, gotta get me some of that
dondavid: moyos sound fun
jmdingess: haha
dondavid: i hate opening theory
jmdingess: meh
dondavid: that's why i stopped playing chess
jmdingess: you grow to like it
jmdingess: ahh
dondavid: who got time for dat
jmdingess: well
jmdingess: if you switch over to 19x
jmdingess: http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall
jmdingess: boom
jmdingess: there's how you win
jmdingess: just build the great wall and play the game like its 9x9
dondavid: hahaha
dondavid: in Chess i'd always just play the Sicilian
dondavid: is there a Go equivalent to that?
jmdingess: I don't know much about chess - what's the idea behind the sicilian
dondavid: Great Wall sounds like The Horn opening in chess where you start by advancing your rook pawns
dondavid: uh with sicilian, white advances king's pawn, black counters with queen bishop pawn to dispute the center
dondavid: it leads to exchanges and an open game and is really easy for black
jmdingess: https://www.chess.com/openings/B20_Sicilian_Defense
dondavid: /flexible
dondavid: and it sounds cool
jmdingess: ah
jmdingess: hahaha
jmdingess: well idk about anything like that
jmdingess: there's no real
jmdingess: "defense" openings
dondavid: with white you just attack and hope black can't keep up
jmdingess: its mostly about what black does
jmdingess: haha
jmdingess: well in 19x, komi is comparatively smaller
jmdingess: so it's white who takes initiative to try to disrupt what blacks doing
jmdingess: instead of 9x9 where black is trying to kill white everywhere to hope to overcome komi
dondavid: haha yeah for black it's kill kill KILL
dondavid: well bedtime
dondavid: cya
jmdingess: yep
jmdingess: see ya
