C[nhm0901: You played very well and has improved a lot! The score is really close and I only won by komi! 
Firstly, don't need to defend at C2. You'd better play at H7 instead.
On the other hand, You played very well in the beginning but before playing B5 you should have played a sente at H7. Because the sequence of B5 finishing by my defence at B7 is your sente (after a sente, you can decide where to move, such as defending somewhere). You should always make sente to gain territories. By that way, I would have been supposed to lose this game ^^ !You can read about sente and gote here
