C[Copacetic: good game
Zwergesel: good game
Zwergesel: no second match?
Zwergesel: I thought you'd get another chance
Zwergesel: since you lost none so far
Copacetic: true
Copacetic: o well
Zwergesel: kinda unfair
Copacetic: i believe i have second tho
Zwergesel: definitely
Copacetic: yeah
Zwergesel: normally the one from the losers tree has to win twice in double elimination
Copacetic: you and i both only lost once
Copacetic: so, i suppose we should play a third time!
Zwergesel: yes
Copacetic: i want my money back
Zwergesel: :D
Copacetic: =P
Zwergesel: we can play an unofficial final match if you want :)
Copacetic: sure!
