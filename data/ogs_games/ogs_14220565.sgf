dovihir: thats why it works
MarcusRienmel: Oh, I see.
MarcusRienmel: So it is some kind of joke. :P
dovihir: lol
MarcusRienmel: Nice.
dovihir: u can win with this option
dovihir: kind of making opponent angry
MarcusRienmel: Don't do it in a ranked game, I know people who would get offended a lot.
dovihir: it doesnt work on rank game
dovihir: i cannot click the rank game button
MarcusRienmel: That's probably for the better.
