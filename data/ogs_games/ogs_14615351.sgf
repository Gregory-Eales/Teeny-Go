C[Scottish_Wayfinder: it was seki
Scottish_Wayfinder: you turned it into a kill
thorina: how?
Scottish_Wayfinder: you lose either way
Scottish_Wayfinder: it was seki if you played g6
thorina: as first move?
Scottish_Wayfinder: then neither of us could kill the other because we have no eye
Scottish_Wayfinder: last move j8
Scottish_Wayfinder: let me kill the stones rather than turning it into a seki
thorina: ok thanks
Scottish_Wayfinder: at g6
thorina: ok thanks
thorina: bye
