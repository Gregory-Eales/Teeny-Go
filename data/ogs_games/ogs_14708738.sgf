C[GoGorilla: I am sorry that you will not get your just reward when you finish beating me. I was on vacation, and elected not to put online-go into vacation mode because I enjoy playing while on vacation. Unfortunately, I had a few busy travel days and timed out in a different game causing me to get thrown out of the 9x9 ladder. I had to rejoin (at #624) so you will unfortunately not get to move ahead of me when you beat me by half a point. Nice game, by the way. Oh yeah, I checked your web site and enjoyed that too...
cliffordvienna: Something similar happened to me a few months ago. You'll be ahead of me again soon enough. And then I'll challenge you again. :)

C[cliffordvienna: Nice to hear you like my projects. Oh, btw. I think I can win this by at least 1.5 points. :D
