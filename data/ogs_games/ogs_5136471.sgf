Jihoonjobbab: 5
Qcoherent: it was 19 vs 18.5 the first time?
Jihoonjobbab: Yes
Qcoherent: so, 1 more point would make it different?
Jihoonjobbab: Yes of course
Qcoherent: I fail to see why it's not clear?
Jihoonjobbab: I was winning by a half point
Qcoherent: yes
Jihoonjobbab: I wasnt sure if leaving it like that or filling in has any difference in scoring
Qcoherent: ah
