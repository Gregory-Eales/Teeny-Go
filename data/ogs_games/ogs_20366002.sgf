C[Blues Clues: isnt the rule that we get the points?
Blues Clues: in seki
Blues Clues: i actually dont know
CalamityVayne: Not sure
CalamityVayne: First time in 1000+ games it's come up
Blues Clues: scrazy
CalamityVayne: Dunno, that's the question. Wierd position for sure
CalamityVayne: XD
CalamityVayne: \[object Object\]
CalamityVayne: So black can capture the two white stones for two more points anyway
snakesss: white wins, right?
snakesss: by 1.5
Ronik: The Japanese Rules say that "eyes in seki" are not counted as territory.
herbie: well this one shouldn't affect the results since both sides got three points out of it
herbie: oh wait no
herbie: I"m blind, didn't see the two white stones being counted as dead xD
