C[Amazing: C5 is sente.
Amazing: Or worth more than H9.
Amazing: \[object Object\]
Amazing: Well, would have probably been only one point,..
Amazing: Still really embarassed about that reading mistake in the middle game :/
Amazing: Well, actually it is much better for White if Black would try to capture with H9
Amazing: \[object Object\]
Amazing: \[object Object\]
Amazing: The H9 capture variation gives Black 5-6 points less.
Amazing: If you want we can review this game later. It was really interesting and reading-intensive compared to the other tournament games.
