C[Oni: thanks
Oni: yeah
ArcticAngel: I'm confused, what's happening
Oni: \[object Object\]
ArcticAngel: That would be better
Oni: can you see all ym variations?
Oni: C3 or E3 or F3 or G3?
Oni: basic rule for kyu is that here is always better moves than empty trangles
Oni: still better than triangle
ArcticAngel: I'm actually ten kyu but I'm really tired so I can't think logically right now
Oni: ArcticAngel: too many triangles
Oni: still
Oni: no excuses
ArcticAngel: I said, I can't think logically, when I'm tired I get really distracted
ArcticAngel: Also what do u mean by triangles
Oni: yeah, still basic rule is no empty triangles
Oni: any thing is better
ArcticAngel: Oh I see, ok, I go by the japanese name of it
Oni: it's last and maybe not even then
ArcticAngel: Also, I'm on mobile, and that was a missclick ,I meant to hane
ArcticAngel: Yes, I know what is wrong with it, I'm not stupid
Oni: \[object Object\]
ArcticAngel: ?!but then I cut at 5h
Oni: but thanks for game, eanna play again?
ArcticAngel: Sir, I'll try to pay beget
ArcticAngel: Play*
ArcticAngel: Better *
ArcticAngel: Sure *
Oni: me too
ArcticAngel: I have a mobile keyboard you draw on
ArcticAngel: Why do I not cut at h5
ArcticAngel: On move 3
ArcticAngel: Yea, I see ur point
Enumaris: too many empty triangles in one line
Enumaris: power triangles work best as lone wolves
Enumaris: should make triangles by themselves in the corners or something
Enumaris: mmm
Enumaris: (trolling)
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: that's something like instinct, instinctually, the empty triangle shouldn't be the first move that comes to mind in a position like that
Schwilliamp: \[object Object\]
Schwilliamp: nono, i'm asking because i don't know
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: I definitely like black here 
Enumaris: the 2 stones look bigger to me than just taking the one stone
Enumaris: although that's possible too
