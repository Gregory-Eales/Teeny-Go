C[qwe: At the moment, i'm trying to sperate your stones. i SHOULD be trying to claim a corner, but for me, if i attack you, i can make you play defensive movves al the time, and if you ONLY play defensive moves, then it means i can think about steering the game.

C[NEWOLDGUY: i do only play defense
NEWOLDGUY: how did you know that
qwe: i have a question about your C6. what was your aim with it?
NEWOLDGUY: trying to get a box started

C[NEWOLDGUY: any comments are helpful
qwe: that works too. the usual reasponse in THIS particular situation is to try to connect underneath with E8, but your F7 works well too. because if I try to then play E8, you will play E6.
