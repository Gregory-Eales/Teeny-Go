C[Animiral: wow
Rainbow Dash: thanks :)
Animiral: what's the komi here?
Rainbow Dash: yeah H3 was bad
Rainbow Dash: 6.5
Animiral: ok
Animiral: great game :)
Rainbow Dash: yeah :)
Animiral: furi kawari on 9x9
Rainbow Dash: it happens more often then you'd think ;)
Animiral: I used to play 9x9 rengo late at night on KGS
Animiral: Another feature that Nova desperately needs :)
Rainbow Dash: eh I hate playing rengo :P been years since I did it last. but I have no issues with others liking it
Rainbow Dash: anyway got to put some laundry in the dryer before playing any more games
Animiral: oh, that reminds me :/
Rainbow Dash: >:D
Animiral: laundry *ergh*
Animiral: (I can imagine that from Rainbow Dash)
Animiral: well, thanks again and have a productive evening :)
Animiral: or rather, whatever time of day you have
Rainbow Dash: 4pm
Rainbow Dash: yeah, I can imagine her saying that as well :P I sometimes want to use quotes from her here but I'm always nervous it will come across as rude
