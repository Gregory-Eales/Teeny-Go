C[spatula: I think we're gonna to fill up the whole board
Enumaris: does it know to make a living group?
spatula: I made it so that it's not gong to play one the first line
spatula: unless pattern matches
Enumaris: will it just let the bottom die by letting me crawl in?
spatula: so it's just going to die
Enumaris: lol
spatula: maybe i should play with some 25k
spatula: to see who fail first
spatula: if you don't touch my stone at opening
spatula: then I'm in serious trouble
spatula: like if you secretly surround me
spatula: then I will die
spatula: for sure
Enumaris: lol
Enumaris: he had a chance
Enumaris: after taking the peep
Enumaris: I didn't pay attention
spatula: are you making a bot as well?
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
spatula: I saw it... 
Enumaris: \[object Object\]
spatula: but It will probably miss it even if I try harder
spatula: still
spatula: cuz it can't really tell life and death
spatula: maybe I could do a very rough estimate, but I haven't factor that into consideration yet
Enumaris: XD
spatula: anyway this is from scratch
spatula: so it's pretty crappy
Enumaris: it's not bad, it can at least play
Enumaris: I was coding a chess bot
Enumaris: can't play yet
spatula: I'm sure your chess bot can beat me when it's done
spatula: good night
