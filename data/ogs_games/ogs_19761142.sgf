C[donutm: it's not fun
donutm: what's the point
donutm: I don't even know why he joins
donutm: it's not even close
donutm: it's like a college pro coming to the playground to beat 5 year olds
donutm: he should even be here
donutm: psychologically he is sick
donutm: why is he here?
donutm: he knows here is no challenge for him
donutm: there is strong players and too strong
donutm: he is too strong
donutm: you have to ask yourself what he is getting out of this?
donutm: I didn't learn anything
donutm: he sadistic
donutm: he's not coaching
donutm: this might even be a program some guy is trying out
BlackToPlay!!: to understand the opponent's moves (any) is the best fun imo in go.
BlackToPlay!!: the mystery...
BlackToPlay!!: It's more like an iron hand kung-fu guy vs a "gentle palm" master...
BlackToPlay!!: lol
BlackToPlay!!: I like the range of players from top to bottom.
BlackToPlay!!: It is good to play strong players imo
BlackToPlay!!: I would cherish being beat to a pulp by such refinement!
BlackToPlay!!: Ok I begin to sound like monty python and the holy grail prisoner...
BlackToPlay!!: I have seen tbgf play and this player plays some excellent moves...
BlackToPlay!!: it is good to see it.
BlackToPlay!!: Much better than AI which is impossible to understand.
BlackToPlay!!: Could be but last game I watched seemed like human moves to me... never know though
BlackToPlay!!: As to skill vs challenge, that's up to the tournie organization surely?
BlackToPlay!!: anyhoo hope my pov was useful to you.
