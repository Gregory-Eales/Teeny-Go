C[3.141: recently
hcsoso: gg
3.141: I had some advice from a higher rank player
hcsoso: another game?
3.141: and it changed how I see games
hcsoso: would you mind to share the advice?
3.141: looked at territory and he played by like
3.141: surrounding
3.141: and making it impossible for me to make eyes from the outside
3.141: and I saw him play another high rank
3.141: score estimate was so undecided
3.141: then suddenly white had everything
hcsoso: right, groups with no eyes chasing each other
3.141: wow by .5
3.141: how about blitz
hcsoso: sure
3.141: this is gonna be so intense lol
