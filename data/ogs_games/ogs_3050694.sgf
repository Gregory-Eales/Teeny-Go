C[User43: No i mean generaly 
User43: Not the game 
pinpoint: recognize life and death situations better

(;B[]
C[User43: Hmmm, 
User43: Well the thing is life and death depend in opponents power 
pinpoint: learn about life and death shapes
User43: Lol
pinpoint: no, not true
pinpoint: there are living shapes and dead shapes
pinpoint: if you learn those, you'll get much better at 9x9
User43: I know 2×3 is dead , and 2×4 xan get seki 
pinpoint: yes
pinpoint: those are simple shapes
pinpoint: there are more shapes that can be reduced to those
pinpoint: once you learn the right sequence to attack or defend them
pinpoint: it doesn't matter how strong your opponent is.
User43: Well i lnow some , well but i was trying to get better results with sacrificing upper to an attack in d
User43: In lower part
pinpoint: in this game, you can't sacrifice your upper group. Your lower group is not big enough to win
pinpoint: you had to either make both live or kill mine
pinpoint: sine mine was connected, you must make the upper group live
User43: Yes and i was trying to kill your groups
pinpoint: that was impossible since mine was connected
pinpoint: when you try to do too much, you often leave your own group vulnerable
pinpoint: you want to do just enough to win, and no total annihilation.
User43: True wwaknes of mine
User43: Weakness 
pinpoint: in other words, don't be too greedy.  :)
pinpoint: I have the same weakness too
User43: Lol gred kills 
User43: You dont sem to have such a weakness lol
pinpoint: when you have enough to win, then the right strategy is to be conservative and protect your win.
pinpoint: I do. I lost many a games trying to win big.
User43: Yes , you are right
User43: Well to be honest  its indeed temptative 
pinpoint: is there anything else I can answer for you?
User43: Well i hot to go now, may i add you ?
pinpoint: I don't know the system very well, so I prefer not to make things complicated. so no friends or groups please. but feel free to join my games in the future.
User43: Ok , anyway 
User43: Thank you for the game 
pinpoint: thank you too
User43: And also ty for your advice 
pinpoint: you are welcome
User43: Have a good day 
pinpoint: you too, bye
User43: And see you soon
