C[ssx: hello, enjoy the game :D
ssx: strange tourney, we play against the same opponent 2 times :p but i like it :)
ST000MA: oh i am sorry about that... i already made a post about that, but looks like it happens often in new OGS so we will have to play with that bug... :(
ST000MA: actualy, most fair would be 3 games for one pair of players, but that is realy too much... :)
ST000MA: Title tournaments are made in that way: 5 matches so cant happen that someone plays worse then usual and lose title...
