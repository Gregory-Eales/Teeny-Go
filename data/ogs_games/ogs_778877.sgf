C[howard.a.landman: Yeah, H3 has been sitting there for a while.  I needed to add another move, but everything in the upper left was sente.
howard.a.landman: Probably my B2 was the game-losing move. If it's at F1 I have no problems now.

C[howard.a.landman: good game.  I still think your original cut at G3 was an overplay, but I failed to punish it properly, so you win.
