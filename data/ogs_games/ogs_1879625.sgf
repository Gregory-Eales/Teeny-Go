C[dexy: Now that you are disqualified, what is the meaning of this game?
gamesorry: Disqualified players can still play out the remaining games since the system doesn't annul all the results for the disqualified players. Thanks for your understanding!

C[dexy: I think you resign now. You do not need this game while I do.
gamesorry: Sorry, that would be unfair for the other players. Just imagine another case: if you win somebody and then he gets disqualified, and then he resigns his game to another player, what would you think? Hope you understand that the situation is not simple :)

C[dexy: Exactly what you say is happening in all tournaments. Some games are well played and after getting disqualified, they bluntly resign the rest of their games.

C[gamesorry: Most players would agree to finish the games *if they are able to*, even if one of the players is disqualified.
dexy: I am only saying what I have seen in tournaments and not wanting you to change your mind. No need for discussion as I respect you for your organising work well done.
