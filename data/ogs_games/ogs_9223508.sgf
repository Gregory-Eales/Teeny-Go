Mu 🦂: later
Motylek: Good night, Andre.
Motylek: I will go too. Have a good night Matthew.
Matthw: point taken, andre?
Matthw: what did i say white should do?
Matthw: basically yeah
Matthw: move 9
Matthw: it looks like black has a huge lead on the board
Matthw: but white knows he has the komi
Matthw: he sees a reducing invasion will suffice
Matthw: it was you that decided on an aggressive response
Matthw: its as good an example of white strategy as you will find
Matthw: unless you have some of francesco's 9x9s around
Matthw: that was damn scary
Matthw: IM a pretty strong 9x9 player
Matthw: but i couldnt get near francesco
Matthw: remember lert?
Matthw: ilop
Matthw: he drops in from time to time
Matthw: play him at 9x9
Matthw: francesco made him look silly
Matthw: perhaps
Matthw: i certainly know there were elements of that
Matthw: but remember his habit?
Matthw: play an account until he lost
Matthw: then change up
Matthw: makes it very hard to keep track 
Matthw: or let people know that we were planning an escape
Matthw: some of the name-changers we contacted through email
Matthw: like emi
Matthw: yes
Matthw: did you have raheel's email?
Matthw: yes!
Matthw: he was there 
Matthw: this month?

Matthw: nicenight knows wheree we are
Matthw: but he wont come
Matthw: i see three names there
Matthw: tuantai
Matthw: boltathor
Matthw: yunonka
Matthw: if you see any of them online or if you have them in your contacts can you message them roughly once a month?
Matthw: i keep forgetting

Matthw: the other would be zigazu
Matthw: later :-)
