C[Zwergesel: gg
la_mudri: Thanks!
Zwergesel: ty
Zwergesel: close one!
la_mudri: E2 was probably my downfall.
Zwergesel: yes, the ko for the corner allowed me to come back
Zwergesel: without that ko I think you were around 5 points ahead
Zwergesel: is there another round now?
Zwergesel: cause it's double elimination?
la_mudri: Apparently, but I think you've won.
Zwergesel: because I'm running out of time
Zwergesel: okay, great ^^
la_mudri: ST000MA was due to play me, but left the tournament.
Zwergesel: somehow the round counter on the tournament page went from 4 in the beginning to 9 now
la_mudri: Jadeite: I think me and thebbb or Elom play off for 3rd.
la_mudri: *play off for 2nd, and the loser gets third.
la_mudri: Knockouts are fun... if you get through! This type of tournament looks interesting, too.
ST000MA: but it was my bad ko
Jadeite: congratulations :)
Jadeite: don;t think so
Jadeite: oh
Jadeite: I wanna know if I got 3rd...lol
Jadeite: yeah
Jadeite: ahh ok
Jadeite: wasn't sure
Jadeite: I've only played one tourny here before, and it wasn't an elimination like this one
Jadeite: was fun though
Jadeite: like the new system
