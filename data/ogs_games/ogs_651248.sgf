C[MarcusRienmel: This one wasn't even close.
MarcusRienmel: Good move, man.
EatenAlive3: Gg, that's why I like playing white on 9x9
EatenAlive3: Thanks. It's called the monkey jump, the one at J7
MarcusRienmel: Nice.
EatenAlive3: You can almost always do it if you're on the second line and your opponent isn't
MarcusRienmel: Gotta go, now.
MarcusRienmel: See you.
EatenAlive3: Alright, Rematch later maybe on 19 :D
MarcusRienmel: I hope not. =P
MarcusRienmel: It's not educative.
EatenAlive3: Haha I can help you see where the holes in your walls are :)
MarcusRienmel: Until I get all the little tricks of 9x9 I won't even start with 13x13.
EatenAlive3: 9x9 is a completely different game
MarcusRienmel: For the strategy, yes.
MarcusRienmel: For the tactics, no.
MarcusRienmel: It's much more tactics.
MarcusRienmel: You can't handle strategy if you don't have perfect tactics.
EatenAlive3: Okay, but don't stay too long perfecting them ;P
MarcusRienmel: I'm a martial artist. =P I use the same principles.
EatenAlive3: Rematch on 9x9 later then ;P
EatenAlive3: Bye
