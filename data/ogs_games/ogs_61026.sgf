C[KyuT: Nice game - 1 point if you defended your group at the end.

C[KyuT: I'm not sure how I would answer F5. (Which is kind of why I played it). Maybe just defend at E3 is good. White is strong so defense is normal, also it leaves miai of C6 and H5 so black should have enough points.

C[KyuT: Ignoring an attachment is usually bad, but in return you did get the two big points so it's ok if you're happy with the followup.

C[KyuT: I don't like this move. Consider you played B7 and then I played D7 it wouldn't make much sense to then play D6 which is what happened in the game. Also remember D5 is your sente so you don't need to strengthen your stones here.

C[KyuT: It is painful to have to answer all this sente against the top right group but that is expected after tenuki the attachment earlier.

C[KyuT: Now white can simply play this way to win by 1 point. Perhaps you can try A8 as a last attempt but I imagine C2 is big enough for white still.

C[KyuT: White has enough points to win now.
