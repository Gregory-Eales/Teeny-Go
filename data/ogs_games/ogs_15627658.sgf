C[S_Alexander: F6 maybe ok for blitz, but not a serious opening
og1L: I don't really play 9x9 ever and I don't even like it :D
og1L: So no idea what is a serious opening in a 9x9 game
S_Alexander: I prepared for 9x9 by playing ladder.
S_Alexander: You played good moves.
S_Alexander: Well, 2-0.
S_Alexander: I got lucky with black both times.
og1L: I am never so sure what I prefer in 9x9 - starting or 7 komi
S_Alexander: I feel like even with 7 komi, it's white who has to defend.
S_Alexander: And think of creative moves.
S_Alexander: thanks for the game
og1L: Thank you
