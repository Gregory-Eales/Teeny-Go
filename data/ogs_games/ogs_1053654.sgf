C[jrhoak: btw, this move (F9) conceals a subtle trap that relies on D4

jrhoak: the problem is that simply connecting means you don't have enough liberties
jrhoak: given the weakness at C6
achew22: Yeah, that's definitely true
achew22: I need to fill that
jrhoak: It's fine now
jrhoak: ggiven C4
jrhoak: (proof left to the reader =)
jrhoak: C6 will probably be most useful if there's a ko
jrhoak: which is very possible
jrhoak: given the board position
jrhoak: (as ko threats)

C[achew22: So I had considered playing G1, is H1 a better move
jrhoak: yes
jrhoak: I can't play at J1
jrhoak: so I'll have to play at J2
jrhoak: The difference is 2 points
jrhoak: which is pretty big

C[jrhoak: good game!
achew22: That game was the most informative one yet
jrhoak: =)
achew22: I don't think I'm making as many blatantly awful moves
jrhoak: nope
achew22: Wanna play again but reduce the handicap by 1?
jrhoak: sounds good
jrhoak: Is that 3?
jrhoak: I think we've been doing 4
