C[xhu98: Oh crap, did I miss an undo request?
xhu98: >.>
thiosev: yep. My fault anyway. shouldn't play before finishing my first coffee.
thiosev: Thanks for the game
xhu98: Thanks for the game! Sorry about that
xhu98: Maybe the coffee was too good :)
thiosev: It was ok if I played g8 right?
xhu98: I think so
xhu98: It was my last jab actually
xhu98: Capturing the seven stones didn't give me the lead :)
xhu98: \[object Object\]
thiosev: Yes that would be tricky.
thiosev: I though I could save the 7 stones at some point.
thiosev: \[object Object\]
thiosev: but it was much harder to read than giving them up.
