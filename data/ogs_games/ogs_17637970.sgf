C[teapoweredrobot: thanks for the game!
qriboh: thanks too!
qriboh: \[object Object\]
qriboh: perhaps E4 could have worked, this would have led to a complicated semeai
teapoweredrobot: Thank you. I did consider E4 but thought it would be too little even if I lived somehow. I seem to often get move order wrong. I need to study my previous games more. I'm at a real plateau I feel.
