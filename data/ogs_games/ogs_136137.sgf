C[LordShaper: This was when I first saw clearly that I was not headed for victory.  I couldn't find anything that didn't make my situation worse, though.
Also don't forget about that 6.5 point komi on these 9x9s!  :)
emilycho: yeah this move seems to work really well for white, i was happy when i saw it ...
and 6.5 komi definitely seems a lot on 9x9
