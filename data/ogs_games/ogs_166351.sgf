C[undume: B E5 W E7 is too passive for black and too good for white, so - E7, a try to divide white groups.

C[undume: I'd prefer to cut black stones: W E5. It looks like black has no territory, but white groups are very weak. It is hard to keep both.
undume: So, W need to divide black stones and egage a battle.

C[undume: So, the key parts:
1. Divide opponent's stones.
2. Attack them by a single move.
3. One group will die =)
