C[false_arelia: like after we are done here...
monster1: gg
false_arelia: thanks
monster1: if we play again
monster1: will you have the same opening again?
monster1: do you just have that one?
false_arelia: I tend to take 3-3
monster1: is that a "yes"
false_arelia: if you start center I take3-5...
monster1: no ... if you are black
false_arelia: I do not start center
false_arelia: I have not that skill
monster1: when you are black ... do you always have the same opening?
false_arelia: If I lose with 3-3 3-3
false_arelia: I try other openings
monster1: ?
false_arelia: If the player is agressive
false_arelia: I challenge for the opening corner
monster1: I think what you are saying is "yes ... I always use the same opening ... forever" unless it doesn't work
monster1: is that correct?
false_arelia: yes
monster1: I tend not to play these opponents
false_arelia: ah
monster1: it seems that "winning"
monster1: is more important then "getting better"
false_arelia: :-)
false_arelia: how do you think I got better?
monster1: I have no idea
false_arelia: 3-3 is very strong
monster1: can you win with another opening?
false_arelia: yes
monster1: how come you don't try it then?
false_arelia: .... I do not thing you will like the answer...
false_arelia: think
monster1: I think I would like the answer
monster1: :>)
false_arelia: go is a game of negotiation
monster1: ... you seem like a nice person
monster1: a good person
false_arelia: and I want you to give me enough space to let me win
monster1: but I have blocked
monster1: 100%
false_arelia: k
monster1: of the players who only have 1 opening
false_arelia: interesting
monster1: perhaps it's because I'm an american ...
monster1: I don't know
false_arelia: I live in maryland
monster1: perhaps we have romantic ideas of rightousness
false_arelia: ?
monster1: I was conceived in Baltimore ...
false_arelia: hohohohohohohohohohoho
false_arelia: and you escaped when?
monster1: my parents escaped when I was -8 months old
monster1: ever heard of "goucher college"?
false_arelia: probably a good decision
false_arelia: yup
monster1: moms went there
false_arelia: you call her moms?
monster1: I call her "miss princess godess mommy"
false_arelia: mine said there is only one of me...
false_arelia: !!
false_arelia: I like it
monster1: Do you believe her?
false_arelia: and did you get what you wanted then?
monster1: from what ... Balitmore?
false_arelia: I believe my mom
monster1: that's probably a good idea
false_arelia: when you called you moms MPGM
false_arelia:  I am going to find another game,
false_arelia: I hope we meet again
monster1: well ... if we meet again
false_arelia: thanks
monster1: and you bring the same opening ...
