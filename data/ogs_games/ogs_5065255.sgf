C[Obbl: Good game
SaroVati: gg
SaroVati: i think
SaroVati: you still could have won
SaroVati: your top right group is alive
SaroVati: and it would turn into a capturing race for top left
Obbl: I don't think I have the reading ability to see it through
SaroVati: ah
SaroVati: yea it is pretty far in
SaroVati: im not sure who would win
SaroVati: but it does look like a fight
SaroVati: the basic start is
SaroVati: H8 and then H9
SaroVati: that ensures your group is alive in the top right
SaroVati: with forcing moves
SaroVati: then you just try to make 2 eyes in the top left
SaroVati: and as I use desperate moves to stop 2 eyes
SaroVati: you surround me from the outside
SaroVati: gg tho
