likebox: games
donutm: congratulations on technion!!!!
likebox: interesting
likebox: I don't GO THERE
donutm: oh ...
likebox: I am just going to go there physically
likebox: To be present there
donutm: oh ... to hang out
likebox: not to be socially integrated into the scene!
donutm: got it
likebox: No, to do research!
likebox: Just nobody will pay me.
donutm: what is your research on?
likebox: I am an unemployed physicist
likebox: I am researching something cool tho
donutm: no jobs at Intel?
likebox: Oh, how do you know so much about Israel?
likebox: This is spooking me out.
likebox: Yes, there are jobs, but for different specialty
donutm: Israel is a great country
likebox: It can be, if not for the political horrors
donutm: yes ... Israel "lives" in a bad neighborhood
donutm: lol
donutm: I have a funny dream.  Where god gets his hands
donutm: scoops up Israel
likebox: And???
donutm: and places it somewhere better on earth
likebox: HA HA!
donutm: like as a island near the UK
donutm: wouldn't that be great!
likebox: I have a not so funny dream where people emit carbon dioxide and Israel becomes too hot to live, and the whole region becomes a gigantic desert with no life.
likebox: Oh way.
likebox: Oh wait
likebox: That's not a dream, that's the reality.
likebox: It's so freaking hot heer over the summer
likebox: It's at least 2 deg C hotter than the 80s
likebox: and even then it was unbearable.
likebox: It's already close to unlivable.
donutm: where in the US did you live?
likebox: NY
donutm: San Jose here
likebox: I love NY.
donutm: NYC?
donutm: me too
likebox: Oh, you're in San Jose??
donutm: yes
likebox: I've been to Santa Barabara
likebox: Is that close?
likebox: They have an institute of theoretical physics
donutm: 4 hour drive
likebox: I think it's close to San Jose, but my memory is failing
donutm: UCSB
likebox: Oh.
likebox: Right
likebox: Southern California didn't do it for me
likebox: I felt like I was in themovies or a TV show
donutm: I live in Northern Cal
likebox: When I watched those things, I would be like
likebox: "NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT!"
donutm: you like Israeli movies?
likebox: "Nobody is THAT SHALLOW!"
likebox: Then I went to Santa Barbara....
likebox: And I was like Oh...
donutm: I saw an israeli horror film
likebox: They got better recently
donutm: a guy was trapped in a basement
likebox: There is a good classic one, called "Salah Shabatti"
likebox: I haven't seen so many modern ones.
likebox: There's a new one that looks pretty good.
donutm: getting torchered
likebox: Oh my god.
donutm: let me look it up
likebox: That's like "Saw" or something
donutm: it was really good
likebox: Horrible.
likebox: I get squeamish about torture horror
likebox: Saw was too sadistic for me.
likebox: I mean, I saw it. I saw "The Human Centipede", but I wouldn't say it brings out the best in humanity
likebox: It's not like the 100 days of Sodom or something
likebox: It's not that good.
likebox: It's not religious, or beautiful underneath the surface.
likebox: It's just ugly all the way down.
donutm: can't find it
donutm: sorry ... great movie
likebox: Wait, are you from San Jose?
donutm: there was another one where there was a nazi hunter
donutm: n a z i
likebox: HA HA!
donutm: hunger
likebox: Censored!!
donutm: hunter
likebox: N a z i
likebox: has become a bad word!
likebox: I like it!
likebox: It's like the gradual transformation of ethnic slurs to unspeakable,
donutm: and he fell in love with the granddaughter
likebox: so it's now the 'n word"
likebox: YES!
likebox: I know it.
likebox: I saw that.
donutm: it was very good
likebox: That was a decade ago.
likebox: That was pretty good
donutm: right
likebox: It's from the 90s
likebox: Late 90s, early 200s
donutm: remember the name?
likebox: 2000s
likebox: I can find it.
likebox: Okay, I can't do this chat anymore, cool to meet you
likebox: Have a good time.
donutm: walk on water
likebox: It's easy to find, Israel only makes a handful of films a year
donutm: that was the name
likebox: Right
donutm: Walk On Water
likebox: It's not THAT good.
donutm: excellent movie
likebox: I liked "Kapara" better.
donutm: oh yeah?
likebox: That was a catalogue of the 1973 war
donutm: huh
donutm: you recommend it?
likebox: It's boring.
donutm: oh
likebox: On purpose
likebox: It's REALLY boring
likebox: Like war is boring
likebox: Until it's not.
likebox: It's the closest thing to being in war you can imagine
donutm: I just saw a south korean movie yesterday
donutm: Parasite
donutm: very good
likebox: Hours and hours of crushing boredom
likebox: THEN BAM!
likebox: Not boring for 10 seconds.
likebox: I will look for it!
likebox: Thanks for the 9x9 tips
donutm: sure
likebox: I will take it to heart.
donutm: play you soon
likebox: I am curious about the AI judgement
likebox: 9x9 is like chess
donutm: try this
donutm: https://online-go.com/puzzle/181
likebox: It might be possible to do a minimax
likebox: I think 9x9 is the same size as chess roughly
likebox: as a game
donutm: chess is harder than 9x9
donutm: but 19x is harder than chess
donutm: be strong my friend
donutm: !!
likebox: thanks!
likebox: You too
donutm: Israel is a dream
donutm: and needs to be protected
