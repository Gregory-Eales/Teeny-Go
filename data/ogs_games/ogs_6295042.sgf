C[bricmar: a messed up match for both of us : p
MrSimple: yeah
MrSimple: :)
bricmar: this semester I'm gonna attend
bricmar: a course
bricmar: on artificial intelligence
bricmar: they're gonna use lisp
MrSimple: ooh, nice
bricmar: have you ever used that?
MrSimple: nope
MrSimple: we used mathlab
MrSimple: for neural networks
bricmar: it's the first (I guess) programming language of the functional paradigm
bricmar: it was created around 1959, if I remember correctly
bricmar: and it's still one of the most used for AI programming
bricmar: mh, I don't hear much about matlab outside of scientific programming - actually, as far as I know on a research level they prefer to switch to other programming languages-
MrSimple: we used it bc it had the neural network tool
MrSimple: so you didnt have to make your own
bricmar: ah, I see
bricmar: what did you use for your own AI gaming script?
bricmar: java?
MrSimple: we didnt really do gaming script
bricmar: yeah, but I remember that you did something like that as your own project
bricmar: maybe for diablo
MrSimple: that had no intelligence
MrSimple: it was scripted
MrSimple: and it used cpp so it could communicate with the os
bricmar: ah, gotcha
bricmar: btw, one of the first project I'd like to work on 
bricmar: would be some chatbot
bricmar: there some nice library for natural language processing
bricmar: in python
bricmar: *there are ** libraries
MrSimple: :)
MrSimple: i got it :)
bricmar: : p
MrSimple: i will be off for a while
MrSimple: see ya later
bricmar: catch you later
