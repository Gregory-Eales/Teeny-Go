C[alskdjfhg: Okay, thank you.
harryyip1996: You are welcome
harryyip1996: May I know what do you wanna test
alskdjfhg: If you in the conditional move function, as soon as your opponent plays it leaves it and your next "conditional" move becomes your actual move, unfortunately.
alskdjfhg: So I could be 5 moves deep, clicking on my 6th move, and if you happen to play just before I click, my 6th move actually gets played on the board.  Obviously it would be in a very wrong spot.
