Lumière: No
Lumière: This doesn't work
Lumière: You are dreaming^^
Lumière: G8 o,stead pf G6 pfr o,sta,ce
Lumière: No
Lumière: Not tsuke for attack

Lumière: \[object Object\]
Lumière: \[object Object\]
Lumière: \[object Object\]
Lumière: \[object Object\]
Lumière: I think 4 is very bad for white in your variation.
Lumière: At your level splurgist do not try to read more than 10 moves^^
Lumière: I would even say no more than 5.
Lumière: I would be happy myself to read 5 moove ahead all the time.
Lumière: But often I loose because I havn't read 3 moves ahead xD
Lumière: Yes
Lumière: But i would say
Lumière: You focus to much on your own flow
Lumière: Try more to disturb the one of your opponent.
Lumière: For instance C4 is far better dans E3
Lumière: See you
Lumière: \[object Object\]
Lumière: Diviser pour mieux régner.
Lumière: Essaye l'autre atari xD
Lumière: En général jouer première ligne c'est mauvais^^
Lumière: Sers à rien d'essayer d'aller aussi loin
Lumière: Même entre joueur en dan on ne fait pas de variation aussi longue^^
Lumière: Oui
Lumière: On avance pas à pas.
Lumière: \[object Object\]
Lumière: Tu as une pierre d'avance tu peux combattre.
Lumière: Comme tu l'a dit
Lumière: On joue souvent à l'instinct
Lumière: Pas besoin de lire 30 coups à l'avance^^
Lumière: Il n'y a que les 6+ dan qui lisent aussi loin.
Lumière: Passe ton bac d'abord
Lumière: Euh
Lumière: Passe kyu à un chiffre d'abord^^
Lumière: A+
