C[cinereaste: Very close! Good game.
RobbertWesterink: gg
cinereaste: I think you could have reduced me by a point by playing A1.
cinereaste: I would have been forced to play A3, lowering my territory by one.
RobbertWesterink: yeah, thought it would count it
RobbertWesterink: well, it was an entertainging game anyway
cinereaste: Indeed!
RobbertWesterink: care for a rematch?
cinereaste: Sure, we can start one. I have to run in a couple minutes, so I won't be able to finish it now.
RobbertWesterink: no problem, i'll send you a request
cinereaste: Great!
