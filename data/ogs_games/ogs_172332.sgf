C[deguoren: I think this is an overplay.

C[deguoren: I played the same overplay for fun! But I had many dobts concerning black e5!
LovroS: I think before I played F3 i was thinking about E5, but i forgot about it by the time i was playing again ;)

C[deguoren: possibly the wrong direction, d6 looks for me much better.
LovroS: oh, jea definately....

C[deguoren: an overplay? But you decided to answere it peaceful - why?
LovroS: i donno sometimes i do that, i start an idea and donno how to finish it. =(

C[deguoren: Because you will not be able to cut thru, I think any other extension (b3 or c4) look much better. After c4 a real cut is possible!
LovroS: how ?
deguoren: black c4 and white has to connect (d5 or d4) and than black can push even to the lower edge. If white ommits the connection and builds territory by c3, black plays e6 and cuts through!
LovroS: ah jea,.. I see! cool ! :D thx !!

C[deguoren: Because you push me to connect with this move, I think d3 would be much better.
LovroS: jea thats true. D3 ?!
deguoren: d3 enlarges your territory by many points without killing your small right sided one.
LovroS: I'm sorry, but maybe we have diffrent coordinate system, bcs d3 is taken by you already in 2nd move... ?!
deguoren: Sorry I meen D8!
LovroS: jea, i was thinking about that... to bad! =)
cool thank you very much for the helpful comments and nice explanaitons.

C[LovroS: what was the idea behind this one ?
