C[MacGyverLizard: gg thx
sterics: thx
playgotorelax: you want to review it, amazing
Amazing: Maybe directly blok at D5
Amazing: the only thing i would have at least considered to play different is 23
Amazing: I think he could have played that C2 even after blocking at D5.
playgotorelax: I would do E1, at 33
Amazing: Considering he gets one of the corners with the bock, he should hae won.
