KJisdead: you didnt give your best
Zyhmet: I did
KJisdead: then maybe you are not used to 9x9
Zyhmet: but I am not playing 9x9 so I guess I wouldnt be 10k on 9x9 anymore
Zyhmet: but there where a few tricky moves in there that could have easily cost you the game ;)
KJisdead: still it was only 1.5
Zyhmet: \[object Object\]
Zyhmet: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: yeah, i knew i could not let you have that
KJisdead: so i forced you to give up one eye
KJisdead: move 57
Zyhmet: yep that was a good one
KJisdead: but why did you not save it
KJisdead: on move 39
Zyhmet: can you find a live variation?
KJisdead: you could have easily made two eyes
Zyhmet: how?
KJisdead: \[object Object\]
Zyhmet: \[object Object\]
Zyhmet: \[object Object\]
KJisdead: yeah, i did not think it through while making variation
KJisdead: :P
Zyhmet: ^^
Zyhmet: I think there is only death for me :C
KJisdead: maybe
KJisdead: lol
Zyhmet: rematch?
KJisdead: i got a low mind stamina
KJisdead: another day for sure
Zyhmet: kk :)
KJisdead: thanks though for the game
KJisdead: and you did not give your best
Zyhmet: u2 :)
Zyhmet: have a good one
KJisdead: you too
