C[GoAinue: now i'm very tempted to play elsewhere and leave this group
Rlim: want to try? :p
GoAinue: but i'm supposed to play solidly O_O
Rlim: lol
GoAinue: \[object Object\]
GoAinue: like that?
Rlim: doesn't white have f5 after?
Rlim: remember g5?  it makes use of yourstone at e5
GoAinue: i see, ok

C[GoAinue: ok
GoAinue: this is called a peek right
Rlim: peep yeah
GoAinue: i have (?) to fill f5?
Rlim: its japanese term sounds better 
Rlim: lol
Rlim: what happens if you don't fill?
GoAinue: i'm doing it in analysis mode but i'm realizing this is taking too much of your time
GoAinue: i'll just fill

C[Rlim: alright
Rlim: it is solid
Rlim: if you didn't and I pushed through, there'd be two cuts right
Rlim: so this is the correct move here

(;W[dg]
C[GoAinue: ok
Rlim: in terms of being solid
GoAinue: i can play g7 to take space, or b4 maybe
GoAinue: i guess g7 is more solid?
GoAinue: but i'd be giving white the entire bottom
Rlim: what are your thoughts behind g7?
GoAinue: it's only a 1 space jump, so it's solid
GoAinue: and it gives me the top right
Rlim: it does gain you territory
Rlim: you can also try attacking d3
Rlim: many options it seems

C[GoAinue: should i reduce white on the left side
Rlim: tbh, one should play all his 9x9 moves on the d4 point :p
GoAinue: or play with sente on right side
Rlim: the latter sounds good

C[Rlim: think you can harrass the bottom left white group?
GoAinue: wait, are you suggesting that i do or?
Rlim: oh just asking

C[GoAinue: i think in these types of simple endgame moves you can spoil me
GoAinue: is h2, h3, or j2 better to end these corner sequences
