C[Bradicalman: Gosh I wish I could beat you once haha. You're too good for me to beat

C[🐬Sofiam🐬: o I' m not
🐬Sofiam🐬: You can defeat me
🐬Sofiam🐬: Now it's hard but not impossible
🐬Sofiam🐬: But you can improve and make it easier
Bradicalman: well it'll be very hard and probably take a while. and a little bit of luck wouldn't hurt
Bradicalman: btw, i promise there is a reason that i play in spots like i am now. it is because in hopes you screw up, not because im stupid enough to think i can actually take it

(;B[gi]
C[🐬Sofiam🐬: I would not think that you are stupid in every case
🐬Sofiam🐬: But I don't like the "I hope my opponent makes a mistake" attitude

(;W[fh]
C[Bradicalman: well im not trying to sound snoby about it
Bradicalman: its just like "if my opponent makes a slip, who knows how the game can change
Bradicalman: does that make me sound bad?
]
(;B[hh]
C[🐬Sofiam🐬: No. You can have bad toughts (And me too of course) but that doesn't make you a bad person
🐬Sofiam🐬: The fact is that trying to win a lost game by forcing your opponent to make a mistake shows that your priority is winning, it should be (imho, but I can be wrong) learning and having fun

(;W[]
C[Bradicalman: well i mean it is just because if they mess up, who knows how the game could change
Bradicalman: it isnt like im thinking "i hope my opponent is a screw up so i can win hehehe". its just like if it works, cool. if not, expected

(;B[]
C[Bradicalman: well gg
🐬Sofiam🐬: But you play things that you know that don't work
🐬Sofiam🐬: I understand your point
🐬Sofiam🐬: Feel free to do it against me every time
🐬Sofiam🐬: But not everyone will like this
Bradicalman: yeah im still trying to learn how to focus more on learning and not winning. but i still have a mindset where if im behind, there is no point in trying
Bradicalman: no point in not*
🐬Sofiam🐬: It's about respect maybe
🐬Sofiam🐬: In this game you lost 1 point by trying btw
Bradicalman: i get that. if someone did it to me, i would get it. but i guess youre right
Bradicalman: and wym?
Bradicalman: ohhh
🐬Sofiam🐬: I don't care, do whatever you want
Bradicalman: yeah i had a plan i was considering  but then decided it wasnt worth it
🐬Sofiam🐬: But I would prefere to resign a lost game
🐬Sofiam🐬: wym?
Bradicalman: here lemme show you what i was thinking
🐬Sofiam🐬: share a variation
Bradicalman: this is the "if it had worked out in my favor" side
Bradicalman: actually nevermind
🐬Sofiam🐬: :D
Bradicalman: i forgot i didnt do it because i saw something that wasnt there
🐬Sofiam🐬: It might happen
Bradicalman: nah i thought i saw you had one less liberty than you actually had
🐬Sofiam🐬: time to sleep for me
🐬Sofiam🐬: 01:19!
Bradicalman: oh dang haha night!
🐬Sofiam🐬: See you
Bradicalman: see ya
