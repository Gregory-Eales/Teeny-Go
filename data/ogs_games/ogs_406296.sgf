C[Thyderion: Not sure I would have made this move, though it's hard to say on a 9x9.  I like to take open corners first as a rule of thumb.
pathogenix: If black had played the 4-4 points, I'd have taken the other corner, but I felt that another move on the bottom would make it un-invadable, so I decided to cut now.

C[Thyderion: Took the corner you left open, figured this way I can be a little more flexible about how I proceed from here.

C[pathogenix: My ambition here is to cut you in three and make sure G7 doesn't get isolated.

C[Thyderion: 3-3 seemed a little slow to me here and my other options were E6 or E7 which didn't appear to develop my position nicely.

C[Thyderion: Cross cut is ok but I think you followed it up wrong.  senseis.xmp.net/ is a good source of go information.

(;B[db]
C[Thyderion: When you're cross cut you want to help the weaker stone first, which was the stone that is cut off.

(;W[ce]
C[pathogenix: I don't remember why I decided to wedge here, B7 better? I think I was happy to sacrifice C7 in exchange for splitting you into three.
Thyderion: If that's the case then you would need to have played more solidly and play D5 instead of E6.  I don't think it would be very easy for me to isolate G7 and even if I do, you can make life there fairly easily.

C[Thyderion: I think with the fact that you atari'd the C6 stone you needed to commit to cutting those stones off otherwise you should have played B7 instead of C5 to strengthen your weak stone.
pathogenix: Agreed ;)

C[Thyderion: Now you've sacrificed two stones and haven't secured any territory in the process so you're quickly falling behind.  9x9 games are brutal.

C[Thyderion: This position is a simple capturing race, you have 3 liberties, I have 3 liberties and I go first so I should win.  What this move does well though is force it to become the capture race which allowed you to build the wall facing the upper right.
pathogenix: Yes, that was my plan at this point, take the wall on the outside and I'm still in good shape, except that G4 lived :/

C[pathogenix: Just started playing on KGS.... man it's cut throat on there. I can't get used to the pace

C[Thyderion: I have an account there but I don't play often because my computer at home doesn't work too well.
Thyderion: This move was too small, you should attack the weak stone and try to secure the rest of the left side.  Something around E2 or F2.
Thyderion: This should say secure the rest of the right side, I'm pretty bad about that sometimes.

C[pathogenix: I think I'll lose this one, but I'm trying different ways of playing... it's hard to keep a balance between fighting spirit and solid play.
Thyderion: Losing 1 point was not nearly as bad as losing the corner would have been, still think you're too focused on the left side.
pathogenix: Yeah, E5 was pretty much the losing move, I think. I expected it to be sente and, in all honesty, I hadn't worked out what to do about the corner, so I kinda ploughed on with something I *did* understand.

C[Thyderion: Couldn't give up any more here without having my stones cut off.

C[Thyderion: Not sure you needed to play this forcing move yet, if the game came down to the 1 point at D5 and you needed a ko threat after this point you'd have one less.

C[Thyderion: The shape that I have in the lower left is starting to look like a mouth shape.  The vital point is H2 and you would have made it very difficult for me if you had played it here.
pathogenix: I've never actually played out the mouth shape in the corner. I think I'd counted territory and decided that with komi I'd be okay IF I could secure what I'd claimed and prevent you from encroaching into the upper right.
Thyderion: But it looks like all you do have is the upper right.  At best D1-E3 is all dame.
Thyderion: If I had played J5 and the typical sequence played out, I'd still have sente and you wouldn't get E3 to make any more territory on the bottom.  The final score would be Black win by 0.5.

C[Thyderion: Notice you've got that shape forming with the stones C2, C3, D4 and E4.
