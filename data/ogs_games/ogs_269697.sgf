C[zealot: d1 was my only chance here.
Any other move lose the game I think.

C[zealot: Here, a7 is a bad move. d9 is now sente for white.
Correct answer was b8.
There was some threats remaining and the game was status was still unclear to me.

C[zealot: Here you could try e9 reverse sente first (bigger than e7) but then white is allowed to play e7 and w will the ko at the bottom. (W+0.5)
