C[xhu98: I think F2 was okay, actually
xhu98: Maybe also F4

C[chycharlie: maybe G2 was better than E2
chycharlie: then J5 is the losing move
chycharlie: where should black play instead of J5?
xhu98: I think G1 may work
xhu98: Essentially White is trying to get extra points by forcing a capturing race

C[chycharlie: Such thing won't be possible under Chinese rule?
chycharlie: White gains one point if black has to play a throw-in move?

C[chycharlie: Thanks for the game.
chycharlie: @gamesorry: Got it.  Will you review this game when you have time?
xhu98: Interesting
gamesorry: Such strategy is still effective under Chinese rule because you play inside instead of filling the dame
