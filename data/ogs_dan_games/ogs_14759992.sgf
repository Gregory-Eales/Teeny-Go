C[dokerbohm: yes i now see that
wurfmaul3: If I let you get the whole upper side I don't have enough, so I try playing there

C[dokerbohm: do i defend these chips down here or go after you chip up there
wurfmaul3: you should play c8 or c6 next

C[wurfmaul3: because now I'm at only two liberties and you can play atari next

wurfmaul3: when two single stones are next to each other like c7 and d7, it's usually urgent to play there

dokerbohm: why would i pass
wurfmaul3: I'm trying to capture stones, but a7 wouldn't help me to capture stones
wurfmaul3: you shouldn't pass, it's just a way to think
dokerbohm: ok
wurfmaul3: If there is a good move for me, the same move is often good for you
dokerbohm: 5c?
dokerbohm: 8d?
wurfmaul3: hmmm
dokerbohm: 6d
wurfmaul3: d8 is right
