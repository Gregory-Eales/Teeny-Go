C[Neandertaler: Hm, to win as black you should play more agressive, I think, that c4 was off-topic. You dont attack my two stones and get difficulties with your two.
Neandertaler: And i think that c2 was too passive. yes it's super-secure, but i think you should have done something for g6, say f7 or e7. I admit, that I'm not 100% sure, so please consult your local dan-ranked player ;-)
Neandertaler: Thank you for the game.
