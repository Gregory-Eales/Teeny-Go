C[mark5000: Resigning is the only guaranteed loss.
mark5000: GG
lovecall: gg
mark5000: I'll try again next time.
mark5000: Maybe h8 is bad.
lovecall: I think
lovecall: f2
lovecall: instead of e2
mark5000: Hmm
mark5000: This is the same. From move 24: F2 F7 E2 D2 
mark5000: But maybe more options than just E2 again.
mark5000: I thought you'd play here afterward. From move 24: F2 E2 
lovecall: I am not sure where I would play
lovecall: I would think of various variations first.
mark5000: I didn't want you to have F1 in endgame
lovecall: yes
lovecall: and i can just make a ko
lovecall: so I understand u point
mark5000: See you.
lovecall: I think f8 give you the most points.
