C[mark5000: This is a teaching game so ask questions generously!
Mumen the Black: yes
Mumen the Black: feel i should play there, since its most popular pro move, although i tend to feel more comfortable playing territorial
Mumen the Black: but i am still beginner in this
mark5000: 4-4 and 4-5 are ok too
Mumen the Black: didnt even consider them
Mumen the Black: will try them out
mark5000: Some pros like 3-4 and 3-5, but they lead to lower win rate in my analysis and on GoQuest.

C[Mumen the Black: never seen the 3-3 in response to tengen
Mumen the Black: i figured e7 wouldnt be good
Mumen the Black: ive played 9x9 for about 90% of my matches the last 3 days maybe, im just recently noticing that once the battle starts, people love to play on the 2nd line first, so as to hane on 1st lines and take sente maybe
mark5000: Neither is a very popular choice. Usually Black pressures White directly with E3 or F3 or even attach.
mark5000: G6 is still playable however.

C[mark5000: I'm not sure my E3 is the best answer though.
mark5000: I don't like it the more I look, but it's ok for a teaching game!
Mumen the Black: lol
Mumen the Black: i still have to figure out how to respond

C[mark5000: Fighty!
mark5000: I'll continue later.
Mumen the Black: i feel i have to
Mumen the Black: i wrestled with playing G3 there instead
Mumen the Black: ok, see you later, gives me time to formulate questions
Mumen the Black: 1st question: According to 81 Little Lions, tsumego problems are probably the best way to improve at the board, and Go in general, how many problems should one do a day to benefit them? two 5kyus, told me, from 1-5 a day?
Mumen the Black: Also, how important is it to study the 9x9 openings?

C[mark5000: Tsumego is pretty important to keep your mind sharp. 1-5 is probably fine, but more is better.
mark5000: Opening is pretty important in 9x9.

mark5000: gg
Mumen the Black: gg
Mumen the Black: hard to formulate questions for this board
mark5000: I think C2 was losing
Mumen the Black: hmm
mark5000: Black should have played on the upper side, near D7
Mumen the Black: interesting
mark5000: Too much territory for White after E7
Mumen the Black: i see what you mean
Mumen the Black: black was pretty secure below
Mumen the Black: so is the key to growing
Mumen the Black: just tsumego and keep playing?
mark5000: Yeah, I think so
mark5000: I like your opening move G6
Mumen the Black: and do you review on 9x9?
mark5000: I do
Mumen the Black: ok, thank you Mark, if i have any questions i will shoot them to you
Mumen the Black: thank you for teaching game
Mumen the Black: unless you see something else i can work on
mark5000: Not really. 9x9 is about reading and counting.
mark5000: It's not as intuitive as 19x19 for that reason.
Mumen the Black: im learning that
Mumen the Black: im an intuitive player
Mumen the Black: so i have to go against what i have always done
Mumen the Black: thanks
Mumen the Black: see you around
mark5000: See you
