C[mark5000: Looks like H5 was too loose.
mark5000: Probably connect. From move 10: F5 
rasavatta: Yes i misread h5
rasavatta: Was my move 7 right?? 
mark5000: It was interesting.
mark5000: I thought you were cutting. From move 8: F3 
mark5000: but maybe it's not good. From move 8: F3 G3 F2 G4 
mark5000: I think just connecting could be stronger.
rasavatta: I thought b9 was worth lot more 
mark5000: B6 was a good move.
rasavatta: Black is 2.5 points ahead right??. From move 10: F5 
rasavatta: Thanks 
rasavatta: In the above variation is black is 2.5 points ahead?? 
mark5000: white looks ahead by 3.5. From move 10: F5 B5 
rasavatta: Black can play c4 or h5 it's open to invasion so i didn't count it
mark5000: H5 can work, but it's just endgame
rasavatta: Oh i see 
mark5000: a bit tricky, but white should be ok. From move 10: F5 B5 D4 C4 F3 G3 F2 G2 C3 E2 B3 
rasavatta: Ahh yes 
mark5000: Actually, i'm not sure about it. White could be in trouble
mark5000: This fighting is good for black because black loses for certain if the game is peaceful.
rasavatta: Yes you are correct 
mark5000: Actually, white can avoid it. From move 10: F5 B5 D4 C3 C4 B4 H4 H3 J4 J3 H6 G3 C6 A6 A7 A5 B8 D5 D6 B3 
mark5000: It seems pretty hard for black in any variation.
rasavatta: Black cannot seem to win in any variation 
mark5000: Probably A or B must be correct here. From move 6: 
mark5000: One more try!. From move 8: C4 
mark5000: 1. From move 8: C4 D4 D5 B4 C6 B5 G3 
rasavatta: I have seen those variations in your editor... What's wrong with e4 instead of A or B 
mark5000: Something like this, maybe
mark5000: It looks like a good move, so I can't say it's bad
mark5000: It's just hard to continue
mark5000: Another way.. From move 8: G3 
mark5000: Maybe black can do this. From move 8: F3 G3 G4 F2 B6 
mark5000: I'm sorry there's too many variations
mark5000: Maybe you have to play A-D here for a good result. From move 8: 
rasavatta: No problem 
mark5000: Maybe the losing move is 9 not 7.
rasavatta: Yes... I understand 
rasavatta: I played c4 too late 
rasavatta: Anyway bye cya 
mark5000: Bye
rasavatta: Got to go... Take care
