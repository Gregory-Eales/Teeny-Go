C[mark5000: Good game
Oda Nobunaga: i thought i could make kos to pull something out my ass
mark5000: Yeah, it didn't amount to much. I could just decline to fight.
Oda Nobunaga: what is your fave 9x9 starter? same as pros? mokuhazushi wasnt the best idea either
mark5000: I think for amateurs anything is fine. I like tengen or 4-5 or 4-4.
Oda Nobunaga: i was too far from it to help. ty ill try em on minus lol
Oda Nobunaga: can you beat it?
Oda Nobunaga: ik you can. my games with it are not 22 points loss usually
mark5000: I don't know! If it's strong maybe not. AI is stronger than pros on all board sizes.
mark5000: Probably here is better. From move 14: F3 
Oda Nobunaga: damn thats a good move -_-
Oda Nobunaga: i bet high level players can fix alot of boards with 1-2 moves on 9x9
mark5000: That sounds pretty much right. 1-2 moves is a lot though!
mark5000: when there are 81 points to play
Oda Nobunaga: rematch? i can take a stone if it would be more fun for you
mark5000: Ok. 1 stone handicap.
Oda Nobunaga: this guest is bored af.. ty
mark5000: lol
