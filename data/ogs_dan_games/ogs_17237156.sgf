C[S_Alexander: E5-G4 is not very common opening.
S_Alexander: White will find a way to tenuki.

C[S_Alexander: F6?

C[mɛkrɪff: F8 G7 D8 I imagine is next
mɛkrɪff: or maybe that's a bit much
S_Alexander: Black E6 I guess.

(;B[cc]
C[Spider Girl Vivian: This is an unusal attack for me but let's see if this works!
Kaworu Nagisa: i think it would work if F8 worked for black
mɛkrɪff: troublesome for both. From move 8: F8 G8 D8 E6 D6 D5 D7 D4 H7 
S_Alexander: why not 2 at E6?
mɛkrɪff: yeah, you're right

C[Spider Girl Vivian: Probably
mɛkrɪff: I hope she has something planned for that
S_Alexander: i also wanted to F5 in my mind
mɛkrɪff: it's an odd cut

C[Spider Girl Vivian: But this is still a fight that has woken me up!~
Kaworu Nagisa: good lol
mɛkrɪff: feels like a dame cut

C[mɛkrɪff: oh she does have plans to try and kill that.

C[Spider Girl Vivian: Shit
Spider Girl Vivian: Okay
Kaworu Nagisa: :s
Spider Girl Vivian: Okay
Spider Girl Vivian: I GOT THIS
mɛkrɪff: yep
S_Alexander: white too good
mɛkrɪff: this is why I said F5 was a dame cut
S_Alexander: what did you want to play?

C[Spider Girl Vivian: I can't read this far ahead but I think this works.
mɛkrɪff: something like this. From move 14: C5 F5 F2 
mɛkrɪff: probably doesn't win, but felt like the only option
S_Alexander: ok
mɛkrɪff: b is probably thinking over H3

C[Kaworu Nagisa: uh
Kaworu Nagisa: you sure
mɛkrɪff: ah here we go
]
(;W[gg]
C[Spider Girl Vivian: yes
Kaworu Nagisa: ok
mɛkrɪff: this is probably the instinct variation. From move 26: F3 F2 G2 G5 G3 E2

C[mɛkrɪff: but I suspect something like this

C[Spider Girl Vivian: This is as far as I got
Spider Girl Vivian: For reading
Spider Girl Vivian: Well
Spider Girl Vivian: I mean a few moves past this
Spider Girl Vivian: But you get the point. It's going as I thought it would.
Spider Girl Vivian: Rather it will work or not though I shall see!
Kaworu Nagisa: the hard part is counting the liberties
Kaworu Nagisa: youve got 3
Spider Girl Vivian: I'm aware
Kaworu Nagisa: like if you cut at D3
Kaworu Nagisa: D3 D4 C3 C2 D3, and then all the groups ahve 3 but its whites turn
mɛkrɪff: oh well, the variation to H2 is what I suspected the actual result to be
mɛkrɪff: D2 is bothersome if b C3 is worth anything
mɛkrɪff: but w can't allow this if he wants to win semeai. From move 31: C3 D2 C2 G5 
]
(;W[dh]
C[Kaworu Nagisa: i meant B3 not D3 for the last move*
mɛkrɪff: w should win this ko tho (I think). From move 32: D3 D4 C3 C2 B3 B2 B6 B5 B4 A4 A3 B7 A5 A6 C4 A4

(;B[ch]
(;W[cg]
C[mɛkrɪff: or I guess he can just extend down.... From move 32: D3 D4 C3 C2 B3 B2 B6 B5 B4 A5 B7 A3

C[S_Alexander: 1. From move 32: D3 D4 C3 C2 B3 G5 
S_Alexander: that's what nagisa was saying about liberties
mɛkrɪff: lol, I missed that
S_Alexander: E1 throw in
mɛkrɪff: G5 first I'd think
]
(;W[ei]
C[S_Alexander: ha!
mɛkrɪff: guess you're right
]
(;B[ci]
C[mɛkrɪff: maybe B4 was an actual threat

C[Spider Girl Vivian: Thank you for the game.
Spider Girl Vivian: This was fun~ Though i wanna paly it out
Kaworu Nagisa: yeah np

C[mɛkrɪff: or I guess it's not really ko anyway
mɛkrɪff: just kind of annoying

(;B[ah]
(;W[ai]
C[Spider Girl Vivian: That was fun~
Kaworu Nagisa: yeah
Kaworu Nagisa: that beginning was fun
Spider Girl Vivian: Yup! <3
Spider Girl Vivian: It looked like it's what had the bigegst chance of letting me win
Kaworu Nagisa: i think this would have been better ahrder for white to do anything, and white has 2 groups to worry about. From move 8: E6 
Spider Girl Vivian: True
Kaworu Nagisa: meant to delete "better:" lol
Kaworu Nagisa: hard to see typing mistakes for long sentences in ogs
Kaworu Nagisa: so i guess the lesson is: your reading is just fine, but you also need to keep track of liberties
Kaworu Nagisa: like our reading was probably close
Spider Girl Vivian: The problem wasn't that I miscounted liberties
Spider Girl Vivian: I was counting on getting more liberties by breaking to the left
Kaworu Nagisa: well also its like "what does black have to worry about? what does white have to worry about?"
Kaworu Nagisa: and this way, none fo blacks stones look out of place or misused
Kaworu Nagisa: then black can attacka nd stuff 
Kaworu Nagisa: if i imagine black having a stone here, i would say "you win" as white. From move 8: E6 C4 
Kaworu Nagisa: still a liberyty issue. From move 32: C3 D3 C2 E1 F1 D1 C1 D4 
Kaworu Nagisa: best case scenario for black and its still not enough because white has sente. From move 32: C3 D3 C2 E1 F1 D1 C1 D4 C4 G1 B5 G5 B6 H8 
Kaworu Nagisa: and the captures are worth twice that area
Kaworu Nagisa: yeah
Kaworu Nagisa: like if the most direct, scary way doesnt work in a fight, then its probably not gonna happen
Kaworu Nagisa: and both will live or the trade will be even
Kaworu Nagisa: assuming no one makes amistake or tenukis or something
Spider Girl Vivian: MEKRIFF
Spider Girl Vivian: IT IS YOUR TURN TO FACE ME
Spider Girl Vivian: Hm one moment
Spider Girl Vivian: OKAY!
Spider Girl Vivian: How about 19x19
mɛkrɪff: gg
mɛkrɪff: yeah, F5 surprised me a bit
mɛkrɪff: wasn't thinking you were going to try and kill top right
mɛkrɪff: yeah, you might've been right
mɛkrɪff: yeah, that would've been my go-to, but I admit F8 is tempting
mɛkrɪff: tbh this was my instinct variation, and I didn't think it worked well enough. From move 32: C3 D3 C2 D1 C4 D4 B5 
mɛkrɪff: that and this reverts
mɛkrɪff: this. From move 32: C3 C2 D3 D4 B3 
mɛkrɪff: yeah, but the point was to make an invasion
mɛkrɪff: but the invasion wasn't good enough
mɛkrɪff: especially since it gives up D7
mɛkrɪff: indeed
mɛkrɪff: which is why I started reading D3
mɛkrɪff: which wasn't good enough
mɛkrɪff: so yeah, the game was probably decided by move 9 or 10
mɛkrɪff: ok, send challenge
mɛkrɪff: As you wish
