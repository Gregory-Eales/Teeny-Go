C[mark5000: Title match for: Alan Turing Nines Title Tournament 2018, or Tengen-Fest 2019.
Deep Scholar: :D Sorry about that I thought if you started with 4-4,4-5,and 5-5. I would also diversify with maybe tengen and 3-5 for fun.

C[mark5000: It's perfectly ok. The openings became diverse after move 1.
mark5000: I stopped playing 4-4 and 4-5 recently. I was unable to refute some better lines my opponents showed me.
Deep Scholar: Ah okay that happens to me every once in a while as well.
