C[Van Fanel: So...
Van Fanel: Are you familiar with the rules of the game?
SerTesko: Yes
Van Fanel: ok
Van Fanel: For now, let's just play "capture Go"
Van Fanel: So don't worry about score or anything
Van Fanel: Just try to capture white
Van Fanel: And try to not get cpatured yourself.
SerTesko: k

C[Van Fanel: So
Van Fanel: How many liberties does that stone have?
SerTesko: ?
Van Fanel: The black stone you just played.
Van Fanel: How many moves away is it from being captured?
SerTesko: 1
Van Fanel: So, it'll be captured right?
SerTesko: yea
Van Fanel: What happens when white captures?
Van Fanel: Is there something specific you have inmind for a followup move?
SerTesko: No i guess i just wasnt thinking
Van Fanel: Ah
Van Fanel: Well
Van Fanel: Despite this being capture go
Van Fanel: That's actually a really good move...
Van Fanel: Let's continue and see what happens.

(;W[gi]
C[SerTesko: k
]
(;B[hi]
C[Van Fanel: White has a group of stones with only 2 liberties.
Van Fanel: Right
Van Fanel: And what happens if white connects?
]
(;W[fi]
C[SerTesko: I can't do much now can i ?
Van Fanel: Count the liberties on whites group!
]
(;B[ci]
C[Van Fanel: Ah
Van Fanel: Why not play A3 directly?
Van Fanel: Er
Van Fanel: C1
Van Fanel: Sorry, I have the labels disabled.
Van Fanel: How many liberties would white have if black played at C1?
SerTesko: Well i was going to play c1 but you could have easilt tooken it over
Van Fanel: Oh?
Van Fanel: But whites group has only the 1 liberty right?
Van Fanel: And what happens to groups/stones that have lost all of their liberties?
SerTesko: They get captured
SerTesko: ?
Van Fanel: YEs
Van Fanel: So what happens if black were to play C1 isntead of B2?
Van Fanel: (click the undo at the top right)
SerTesko: oh i would of captured all of those 
Van Fanel: Totally.
Van Fanel: Can black capture this?
]
(;W[ge]
C[SerTesko: Maybe
]
(;B[fd]
C[Van Fanel: So, what does that move do?
Van Fanel: What are you trying to prevent?
SerTesko: White expanding
]
(;W[fe]
C[Van Fanel: So if white does this?
]
(;B[ee]
C[Van Fanel: Ok
Van Fanel: There are 2 ways for white to live.
Van Fanel: The easiest is just to run and connect to a livign group
Van Fanel: The other way is to make 2 eyes
Van Fanel: Are you familair with that?
SerTesko: yea
Van Fanel: Alright
Van Fanel: So now white is gonna have to try to make 2 eyes on the side

C[SerTesko: shoot
Van Fanel: So what happens if black connects to the 2 stones?
SerTesko: black lives
SerTesko: wait
SerTesko: hmm
Van Fanel: Let's look at whites 2 stones at the top right.
]
(;B[ha]
C[Van Fanel:  Something very similar to what happened to white below.
Van Fanel: Notice how black has 2 liberties now
Van Fanel: And it's whites turn to play
SerTesko: yea i lost it
Van Fanel: So
Van Fanel: That move doesn't work
Van Fanel: Let's undo and think about something else.
Van Fanel: They also have 2 liberties and its blacks turn to play
Van Fanel: RIght
Van Fanel: So now white is forced to take that one lowly stone
Van Fanel: But now you see another problem.
Van Fanel: Black would like to play G8
Van Fanel: And force white to play H6
Van Fanel: But there are 2 black stones that are in atari at the top right
SerTesko: I'll lose thos anyways
Van Fanel: Sure
Van Fanel: But then white has 2 eyes no?
]
(;W[id]
C[SerTesko: Hmm
Van Fanel: So
Van Fanel: I think the problem was those 2 stones in the first place.
SerTesko: Yea 
Van Fanel: Black got too aggressive.
Van Fanel: Strangely enough, aggression just doesn't really work in Go.
Van Fanel: Often it's the more peaceful (but strong) mvoes that are the best.
]
(;B[gb]
(;W[ia]
C[Van Fanel: White does have that 1 stone that is in atari
Van Fanel: At the top right
Van Fanel: I9
Van Fanel: Uh
]
(;B[ib]
C[Van Fanel: Hm
Van Fanel: Just to see something interesting, lets undo
Van Fanel: Right
]
(;W[ic]
C[Van Fanel: Now black should connect H9 to G9
]
(;B[ga]
C[Van Fanel: And then we have a little fight over that one sto
Van Fanel: stone
Van Fanel: This is called a ko
Van Fanel: (its a meaningless ko for white , but still
]
(;W[ia]
C[Van Fanel: Notice that black can't play there right awy
SerTesko: yea
Van Fanel: The reason for this is that both players would jsut get an infinite amount of points if it were possible.
Van Fanel: Therefore, the ko rule was invented.
SerTesko: Yea I noticed this in my other games
Van Fanel: Yeah
Van Fanel: It means that neither player can revert the board to a previous state.
Van Fanel: If black captures now, it goes back to 2 moves ago.
Van Fanel: That means black has to change the board.
Van Fanel: Black wants to play and take the ko
Van Fanel: Therefore, black has to paly something white will respond to
Van Fanel: So you look for very threatening moves
Van Fanel: Something like extending to B1 at the bottom left
Van Fanel: That threatens to kill a lot of white territory.
]
(;B[bi]
C[Van Fanel: So
Van Fanel: If white doesnt respond, white can fill in the ko
Van Fanel: (Ive requested an undo)
Van Fanel: (please undo as well)
]
(;W[bh]
C[Van Fanel: However..
Van Fanel: Now black can play and take the ko.
]
(;B[ib]
C[Van Fanel: So... white does the same
]
(;W[fc]
(;B[ec]
(;W[ia]
(;B[ah]
C[Van Fanel: And this continues until either one player just decides to stop
Van Fanel: Or one plyer runs out of threatening mvoes
]
(;W[ag]
C[SerTesko: well Black will get captured
Van Fanel: Right
]
(;B[bg]
C[Van Fanel: Ah so
SerTesko: oops
Van Fanel: Yeah
Van Fanel: You can undo
Van Fanel: Why is that a bad move?
Van Fanel: And black can take the ko at the top
]
(;W[bf]
(;B[ib]
(;W[ai]
C[Van Fanel: Until the threat is only as valuable as the ko.
]
(;B[di]
C[Van Fanel: A ko like that, that doesnt determine life and death
Van Fanel: Is only worth 1 point
Van Fanel: If white played D1, he gets 3 points.
Van Fanel: So you kinda whittle down the threats

(;W[ia]
C[Van Fanel: So

(;B[de]

(;W[ed]
(;B[df]
C[Van Fanel: Ah
Van Fanel: One of your stones is in atari, isnt it?
SerTesko: Yea
Van Fanel: Is it a vital stone?
Van Fanel: Is it protecting an eye?
SerTesko: I dont think so
Van Fanel: Does that group have 2 full eyes yet?
Van Fanel: Well
]
(;W[fc]
C[Van Fanel: Lets look at the health of the group now
Van Fanel: It's not yet connected to a livign group
Van Fanel: Nor does it have 2 eyes
Van Fanel: Therefore, you should protect it
SerTesko: Well thanks for the help but I gotta go now
Van Fanel: Ah no problem
SerTesko: hope to see you later
Van Fanel: See you later!
Van Fanel: I'll add you to freinds.
SerTesko: k
Van Fanel: Cya later.
Van Fanel: Take care.
SerTesko: cya
