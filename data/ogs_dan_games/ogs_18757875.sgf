C[martin3141: thanks
Respekto: Hello !
Respekto: Have fun :-)
martin3141: that's a little late for greetings
Respekto: As you say ;-)
Respekto: Better just tahnk once victory is assured, right ?
martin3141: I always say thanks after a game, doesn't matter if I win or lose
Respekto: Sure
martin3141: as is, your lower-left group dies if I play a2
Respekto: ok !
martin3141: I thought I'd tell you that. Since the last time, you wanted advice
martin3141: Next time, remember to make a living shape.
Respekto: ok !
Respekto: yes 
Respekto: I want advice 
martin3141: There you have it
Respekto: But I have a very hard time considering the advices of someone that does not greet, but that definitely thank once victory is assured first 
Respekto: It breaks the mutual respect, necessary for me to consider advices ;-)
Respekto: have fun around!
