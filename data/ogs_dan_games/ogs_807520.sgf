wurfmaul: Oh, really? I have played over 200 probably. But I don't know how much of an advantage that will give.

C[wurfmaul: thank you
xhu98: thank you :)
xhu98: I turned that one around
wurfmaul: maybe you can show me which moves you feared?
xhu98: in the beginning
xhu98: Because I was confined to the top right corner
xhu98: D6 was a desperate move
wurfmaul: but I obviously found it difficult to handle
xhu98: B6 would do I think
xhu98: this. From move 18: B6 D5 E4 E5 F5 
wurfmaul: oh, hm
wurfmaul: interesting.
xhu98: My F7 was bad
xhu98: Should have just mirrored your move xP
wurfmaul: Sounds reasonable
xhu98: My theory of approaching smaller boards is still forming xP
wurfmaul: it's already as good as mine
xhu98: White 28 was a good move I think
wurfmaul: Maybe black should answer a4?
xhu98: White A3?
wurfmaul: black a5?
xhu98: White A7
xhu98: Oh okay
xhu98: Black has one more liberty I think
wurfmaul: maybe
xhu98: Black can play at E8 first
xhu98: So that White won't be able to fill in that corner liberty
wurfmaul: Yes, I saw that in a variation that I put on the board
wurfmaul: on my private board
wurfmaul: there are surely many variations
xhu98: analyze mode?
wurfmaul: yes
xhu98: In the game I got A4
xhu98: Which was huge imo
wurfmaul: Yes, I don't see a good way for black after white gets a4
xhu98: yup
xhu98: Black F4 maybe?
wurfmaul: an exchange?
xhu98: Yep
wurfmaul: black will capture the lower right and white the lower left?
xhu98: White captures the top left
xhu98: Then Black might still end up with more than half of the board?
wurfmaul: seems close to me, but I feel white wins i.e. I hope white wins
xhu98: yeah it's gonna be close anyways
xhu98: It's 9x9 :)
wurfmaul: surely better for black than the game
wurfmaul: h
wurfmaul: oops. Thanks for the game and the review.
xhu98: Haha thanks
xhu98: Well played
wurfmaul: You too. Bye!
xhu98: o/
Marnoris: another another :D
Marnoris: it's a match in 2 won games :)
ssx: nice game :D i thought that black could have win
