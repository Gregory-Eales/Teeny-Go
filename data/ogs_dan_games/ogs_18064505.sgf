C[goshifu: ggty
Neandertaler: Thank you for the game. 
Neandertaler: I shouldn't have broken the symmetry....
goshifu: can u review?
Neandertaler: Well, not every move. H5 was bad, because it was not able to kill one of your groups (what i hoped for).
Neandertaler: Until then i felt good, because tengen was not a meaningful move for black.
Neandertaler: Something personal: if someone like you plays e4 agains me, I alway play symmetricla. This leads often to funny positions.
Neandertaler: The main question is: can black break the symmetry by playin in the middle
Neandertaler: without ruining his position. Often he can't :-?
Neandertaler: Sorry. type: this smiley :-)
goshifu: cool ty
Neandertaler: No need for an excuse - that move is well playable if black ist prepared for the symmetry.
Neandertaler: Bye. Hope to meet you soon again.
goshifu: instead of h5, you should play symmetry at b4
goshifu: that was my worry
goshifu: gg, later; i am just happy i can win someone in the dan level; i havenâ€™t played well in my recent games
