C[mark5000: Thanks
OGSER: GG
mark5000: I think, you were doing okay at first
mark5000: this move should be here. From move 16: H2 
OGSER: I was listening to the beatles
OGSER: then the music stoppd :/
mark5000: shucks
OGSER: makes sense
OGSER: I need to work on tight coners
mark5000: Black had no chance after that, but your first 8 moves were pretty good
OGSER: I always get scared and make a wierd mistake
OGSER: thanks
OGSER: I don't atually think im 16k
mark5000: It's just you didn't count the consequences of having one less liberty there
OGSER: but somewhere around 15 or something
OGSER: yeah
OGSER: I didn't read it right
OGSER: i liked f4
OGSER: although if i would have been in your shoes i would not have known how to play it
mark5000: I didn't really know either. I just made a good shape and started cutting stuff
OGSER: true, in 9x9 i really see such a tight shape in the middle
OGSER: *dont really
mark5000: I think a lot of players underestimate the value of the center
OGSER: for me it's scary to play
mark5000: It's really important to control the game like that
OGSER: because I always end up going too big
mark5000: but I've seen a lot of dual 3-3 instead, and it's slow
OGSER: i will try this shape at some point
OGSER: I used to play 3x3
OGSER: but no anymore
OGSER: I think peole only do it becasue that's how bigger boards are played
OGSER: but the logistics are off
mark5000: exactly
OGSER: anyway thanks for the game
OGSER: We shall play again! sometime
mark5000: you're welcome
