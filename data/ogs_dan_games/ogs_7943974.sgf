C[roy7: haha
roy7: What was I thinking
Kaworu Nagisa: just take your time
Kaworu Nagisa: you could have capturted them
roy7: J1 first gets me there right
Kaworu Nagisa: other direction. From move 60: J1 
roy7: By about turn 18 you had the same shape I think as the last time i played you
Kaworu Nagisa: lol
Kaworu Nagisa: well
Kaworu Nagisa: territory is what matters
Kaworu Nagisa: theres no territory in the centre
roy7: Was my g5 too agressive?
Kaworu Nagisa: yeah
Kaworu Nagisa: if you cant cut why play it
Kaworu Nagisa: territory is what matters
Kaworu Nagisa: g5 gives you no territory
roy7: I was thinking I could cut but I should know a 2 space jump can't be cut
roy7: So maybe F4 instead?
Kaworu Nagisa: no
Kaworu Nagisa: look at what white palyed
Kaworu Nagisa: white has territory. black does not. From move 4: 
Kaworu Nagisa: only 3rd and 4t lines cna be territory
Kaworu Nagisa: 3rd line. From move 0: 
roy7: I was thinking I'd give you right side but I'd have more influence on left, but you can invade left on the 3rd line just fine and that's what you did.
Kaworu Nagisa: 4th lien stones are invadable
Kaworu Nagisa: you had 5th lien stones
Kaworu Nagisa: simple, safe groups. their territory can be counted. From move 0: F7 G5 C3 C6 
roy7: Maybe this weekend we can play some more, I have plans tomorrow and friday night be Ten
Kaworu Nagisa: sure man
Kaworu Nagisa: but
Kaworu Nagisa: i think jsut stick to these two for now on
Kaworu Nagisa: it will be easier to win and harder for your opponents to damage them
roy7: /me nods
Kaworu Nagisa: cya man
