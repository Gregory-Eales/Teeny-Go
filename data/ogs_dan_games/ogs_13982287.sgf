C[WongGuoRong: damn i got trapped instead
wurfmaul3: let's look at what went wrong then?
WongGuoRong: \[object Object\]
WongGuoRong: ah ok
WongGuoRong: finally found it
wurfmaul3: Resign and let's go back to the review?
WongGuoRong: my three black stones B4 C4 and C3 arent dead yet?
WongGuoRong: hard to see how to create two eyes there
wurfmaul3: If you're not sure, try to survive

C[wurfmaul3: You couldn't save them
WongGuoRong: hmm
WongGuoRong: so this game is lost already?
wurfmaul3: If we play normal Go, maybe it's not lost yet
wurfmaul3: but let's not do that
WongGuoRong: the mistake i made was to cut in at C4?
wurfmaul3: No
wurfmaul3: This mistake was f3
WongGuoRong: thats the problem, i lt lose games without knowing where it was
wurfmaul3: I know it can be difficult
WongGuoRong: F3? isn't connecting up to form more libs and strength that side a good move?
WongGuoRong: you mean i wasted a move to connect up the iron pillar and allow you a free move to attack?
wurfmaul3: If you play f3, I play c2 and your two stones are captured
wurfmaul3: I mean the c3 and c4 stones
wurfmaul3: To be precise, they are dead, not captured yet
wurfmaul3: f3 helps e3 and g3, that's true
WongGuoRong: hmm ok so instead of F3 where will you play instead?
wurfmaul3: and b4, a5 or c6
wurfmaul3: Because then you capture the two stones before I can capture anything
WongGuoRong: oh i see
WongGuoRong: i did not count the number of libs your 2 white stones there had compared to the other groups
wurfmaul3: Maybe f3 is not the "real" mistake that lost you the game
wurfmaul3: At move 12, if you connect at d3, there is no problem for you
WongGuoRong: can i go to review now?
wurfmaul3: sure
WongGuoRong: instead of B6 move, make a connect at D3?
wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: Then all your stones are connected and safe
WongGuoRong: this move aims to capture your middle 3 stones?
wurfmaul3: Black has a weakness at d3. When white plays at d3, the black stones at c3, c4 and d3 become threatened, so it becomes difficult for black
wurfmaul3: Black plays d3 to fix this weakness
wurfmaul3: By fixing the weakness, black also keeps the white stones dead
WongGuoRong: I see
wurfmaul3: The white stones can hardly survive without capturing anything, so if black makes sure white doesn't captuer anything, they're as good as dead
WongGuoRong: but that is because i have handicap stones right
wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: but there can be similiar situations in even games
WongGuoRong: I see
WongGuoRong: can i have one more game?
wurfmaul3: yes, sure
wurfmaul3: Let me say one more thing though
wurfmaul3: The weakness at d3 became more severe because I got the stone at e4
wurfmaul3: hmm
wurfmaul3: e4 took a liberty of the e3 stone, that's why it became dangerous
wurfmaul3: Well, challenge me to a rematch if you want
WongGuoRong: if E4 is not there, i can afford not to connect up at D3?
wurfmaul3: right
wurfmaul3: because then, if I play d3, you can just play d2
WongGuoRong: Is E4 call an attach to my black E3 stone?
wurfmaul3: No, not really
WongGuoRong: oh i read that attach requires urgent move to react
WongGuoRong: then whats an attach?
wurfmaul3: it would be an attachment if my stone at e4 was lonely
WongGuoRong: i thought attach means placing a stone directly to the side of the opposition stone
wurfmaul3: it actually means a little more. It's not called an attach if the stone has friendly neighbors
WongGuoRong: what do you mean by lonely, i dont understand
WongGuoRong: oh ok
wurfmaul3: e4 is connected to d4 and e5
wurfmaul3: d4 and e5 are e4's "friends", so e4 is "not lonely"
WongGuoRong: ok, understood
wurfmaul3: Anyway, it is urgent to reply, for the same reason that attachments are urgent to reply to
WongGuoRong: but even if this is not an attachment, it still requires me to reply?
wurfmaul3: yes
WongGuoRong: I see
WongGuoRong: 1 space jumps, knight moves don't need urgent reply?
wurfmaul3: it depends, but usually they are not as urgent to reply to as attachments or moves like e4
WongGuoRong: I see 
WongGuoRong: ok noted for this mistake
WongGuoRong: will try a new one
