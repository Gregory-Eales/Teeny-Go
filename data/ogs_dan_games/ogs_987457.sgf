C[ST000MA: what is your favourite board size?
mark5000: That's tricky. I think 13x13, actually. 19x19 is a long time.

C[ST000MA: i prefer 9x9, but 19x19 is so interesting sometimes, you play for long time, think and that is fun

C[mark5000: In 19x19, there's this whole dynamic that's absent from 9x9. A fight of territory and influence.

C[ST000MA: and 13x13?
mark5000: It's similar. It's only that the values are different. It's unbalanced, but it's a more agreeable timeframe.

C[ST000MA: thats why beginners play 13x13 often to prepare for 19x19...

C[mark5000: Beginners shouldn't stay too long though. They're different games. Patterns that are good on 13x13 are bad at 19x19.

C[ST000MA: i am pretty bad at opening on 13x13. is there going to be some opening explorer or something for 13x13?
mark5000: Well, I don't have any pro 13x13 games.
ST000MA: oh, i see...
mark5000: I don't know any.
mark5000: There's one 9p vs. Zen bot, but it was reverse handicap.
