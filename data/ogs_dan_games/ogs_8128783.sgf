HansNa: okay
HansNa: my end game
HansNa: is not good T.T
HansNa: sorry master
HansNa: yes ovo the master
mark5000: OVO is the ratings sensei
HansNa: i goquest hard recent days
HansNa: ovo is so powerful
mark5000: How so?
HansNa: you dont think i will play like that/?
HansNa: 11. From move 18: H4 D2 C2 J2 D1 G4 G5 G2 H1 E4 F5 D5 
HansNa: hehe
mark5000: I'm looking too
HansNa: 13. From move 12: E2 D2 G2 E1 H3 D5 
mark5000: I think G7 was slow too, and I can't get a good result afterwards.
HansNa: 14. From move 4: F8 
HansNa: so usually this first?
HansNa: was considering this
HansNa: but
HansNa: no threatening at all
mark5000: Maybe here at this timing. From move 10: C7 
mark5000: idea. From move 10: C7 D6 C8 D8 C4 
mark5000: lol
HansNa: :(
HansNa: ovo is stronger than me
mark5000: next time I play there
HansNa: G2
HansNa: is live
HansNa: E2 then H3
mark5000: idea2. From move 10: C7 C6 D6 D8 C5 B6 B5 B7 G2 
mark5000: Yes! :)
mark5000: Last move of yours maybe better than mine
HansNa: in goquest
HansNa: its 7 komi
mark5000: I think 6 komi japan and 7 komi china is good.
HansNa: chinesse rule
HansNa: i practice there for 9X9
HansNa: ask mark....
mark5000: Why .5 at all? :)
HansNa: perhaps XD
mark5000: .5 is to avoid draws
mark5000: lol
mark5000: And...we don't know for certain what is good komi
HansNa: with komi 7 i usually play
HansNa: strategy is only make 2 live group
HansNa: or one group live big
HansNa: lol
mark5000: 7x7 komi is 9
mark5000: chinese rules only
mark5000: 5x5 komi is 25. lol
HansNa: chinesse rule is 7 isnt it?
mark5000: 9 is too much for 19x19. AlphaGo thinks White is good.
mark5000: with 7.5
mark5000: Thanks for the game
mark5000: Both
HansNa: thank you
HansNa: see you around mark
EricJHan: Not a lot
EricJHan: But enough
✨霖铃✨OVO: mark5000   )<,<(( lost
✨霖铃✨OVO: not really
✨霖铃✨OVO: you could win more
✨霖铃✨OVO: 8. From move 39: J6 
✨霖铃✨OVO: he can't block
✨霖铃✨OVO: so there is one point difference
✨霖铃✨OVO: horrible
✨霖铃✨OVO: but you are 1p in 9x9
✨霖铃✨OVO: >< no
✨霖铃✨OVO: mark5000 is 5d
pan piper: OVO is the master?
✨霖铃✨OVO: so you are 1p
✨霖铃✨OVO: ....
✨霖铃✨OVO: i need to resign all my correspondence games
✨霖铃✨OVO: so people don't blame for my "3d"
✨霖铃✨OVO: 9. From move 18: H4 
✨霖铃✨OVO: but mark5000
✨霖铃✨OVO: this way i think white dead
✨霖铃✨OVO: 10. From move 18: H4 D2 C2 J2 G1 H1 D1 G2 C8 
✨霖铃✨OVO: not dead but better than real game
✨霖铃✨OVO: 12. From move 18: H4 D2 C2 J2 G1 G2 D1 H1 C8 
✨霖铃✨OVO: i like white
✨霖铃✨OVO: i think black F7, G7
✨霖铃✨OVO: too slow
✨霖铃✨OVO: but can't find better way for black
✨霖铃✨OVO: maybe because HansNa is 1p ..
✨霖铃✨OVO: just feel this is white's game
✨霖铃✨OVO: black best result is 0.5 loss
✨霖铃✨OVO: 15. From move 14: C7 D6 C6 
✨霖铃✨OVO: this , i played before, . From move 4: F8 D7 E6 C4 F3 
✨霖铃✨OVO: feels like overplay
✨霖铃✨OVO: HansNa 1p now
✨霖铃✨OVO: thanks for your game >))
✨霖铃✨OVO: i am learning from both of you
✨霖铃✨OVO: so i can stay longer in 1st 9x9 ladder
✨霖铃✨OVO: no
✨霖铃✨OVO: mark5000 idea
✨霖铃✨OVO: variation
✨霖铃✨OVO: is good
✨霖铃✨OVO: i feel white have to die one group
✨霖铃✨OVO: 16. From move 10: C7 C6 D8 D6 C8 G7 
✨霖铃✨OVO: 17. From move 10: C7 C6 D6 D8 C5 B6 B5 B7 D2 
✨霖铃✨OVO: 18. From move 10: C7 D6 C8 D8 C4 G2 C6 G7 
✨霖铃✨OVO: wow
✨霖铃✨OVO: mark5000 agree to me
✨霖铃✨OVO: i think 9x9
✨霖铃✨OVO: is too big komi
✨霖铃✨OVO: just feel like black is so disadvantage
✨霖铃✨OVO: white only need to make 2 groups alive
✨霖铃✨OVO: then he maybe just win
✨霖铃✨OVO: !
✨霖铃✨OVO: why 5.5 in chinese and Japanse then?
✨霖铃✨OVO: in ogs
✨霖铃✨OVO: what about 0.005
✨霖铃✨OVO: then that is more accruate
✨霖铃✨OVO: computer result is 9 komi
✨霖铃✨OVO: for 19x19
✨霖铃✨OVO: from a go megazine
✨霖铃✨OVO: but for small board
✨霖铃✨OVO: they think komi is 7
✨霖铃✨OVO: yes
✨霖铃✨OVO: they predict, 19x19  or bigger board
✨霖铃✨OVO: komi is 9
✨霖铃✨OVO: but for 9x9 is 7 or 6
✨霖铃✨OVO: but now 7.5 komi in chinese, players already likes white
✨霖铃✨OVO: KeJie played as white 34 wins no loss
✨霖铃✨OVO: that is the best prove
✨霖铃✨OVO: we should ask pros
✨霖铃✨OVO: about 9x9 komi
✨霖铃✨OVO: i sometimes lost by 0.5, very sad
