C[mark5000: You're fine
HowToPlay?: d1. From move 4: E5 D5 F5 D4 
HowToPlay?: would it have turned out that way?
HowToPlay?: and would that have been better for me
mark5000: d1. From move 4: E5 F5 D5 D4 
mark5000: I think your move in the real game was better
mark5000: Wedging too early is a mistake
HowToPlay?: glad i made the right choice then
mark5000: Yeah. It's a draw. Not too bad
HowToPlay?: im wondering if you forced the tie though?
HowToPlay?: i know its like a teaching game so your trying to guide me to the right moves
mark5000: It's a teaching game.
mark5000: Yeah
HowToPlay?: with your play right?
mark5000: Yes
HowToPlay?: so 16k then?
mark5000: Stronger, if this result is normal for you
HowToPlay?: sometimes i overlook simple thing that require a facewall
mark5000: You played at 10k level here.
HowToPlay?: but on 9x9 i just try to get a little more then hlaf the board as black
HowToPlay?: and a little less then hlaf as white
HowToPlay?: half
mark5000: Yeah. That's a simple way
mark5000: I'm not surprised you're weak against aggressive players thinking that way
mark5000: Very often as white you have to make a second group b/c black is aggressive
mark5000: If you don't, aggression will make you lose
mark5000: For me it's about 50/50
mark5000: Either I make one half-sized group or I make two small groups
mark5000: Depending on the aggression of the enemy player
HowToPlay?: well thanks for the game
mark5000: I don't have too much advice since you played a decent game
mark5000: move 11 was too slow
HowToPlay?: maybe another 9x9 when you go super aggressive?
mark5000: extend here. From move 10: H4 
mark5000: If you want
HowToPlay?: yes please
