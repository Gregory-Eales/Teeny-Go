C[RejectDrake: hello
RejectDrake: what opening moves would you first consider playing? mines is tengen but is there a better move to play?
mark5000: hello! ask lots of questions.
RejectDrake: dont you worry about that
mark5000: nobody knows what the best opening move is, but tengen is probably one of them.
RejectDrake: ok
mark5000: other moves that may be good are the 5-4 point and the 4-4 point.
mark5000: center control is pretty important in 9x9

C[RejectDrake: ?
RejectDrake: 5-4?
mark5000: intersections in Go are defined by how many points from the edge they are
RejectDrake: how would you respond to this? c4 i mean
mark5000: 5-4 means 5 points up from one edge and 4 points up from another edge
RejectDrake: ok
mark5000: tengen is 5-5
mark5000: 5-4 is one space off tengen
mark5000: 4-4 is one space and another space in another direction
mark5000: or a diagonal move away.
RejectDrake: ok
mark5000: how would I respond?
RejectDrake: yes
mark5000: I think lots of moves are possible
RejectDrake: how many good ones are there?
RejectDrake: i always play c6
mark5000: about 7
mark5000: c6 is one of them
RejectDrake: ok
RejectDrake: is there a better one?
mark5000: maybe one of these. From move 2: 
mark5000: And no, I think they're pretty equal

C[mark5000: i'll make a base in the corner
RejectDrake: hmmm
RejectDrake: what moves would u consider
mark5000: if you ask every move the whole game it's like playing myself :)
RejectDrake: currently, im considering g7 or g5
RejectDrake: is that among the moves that are good to play?
mark5000: why g7 and g5?
RejectDrake: g7
RejectDrake: takes the top corner
RejectDrake: s
RejectDrake: and g5
RejectDrake: because it allows me to subtly invade
RejectDrake: if u play
RejectDrake: g3
RejectDrake: i can play g7 next
RejectDrake: and vice versa
mark5000: those seem like good plans to me
RejectDrake: but, with all my research
RejectDrake: i dont know if they are good moves
RejectDrake: they seem ok
RejectDrake: but im not 100% sure
mark5000: do you want my opinion before you play or after?
RejectDrake: before
mark5000: g7 looks a bit conservative
mark5000: g5 is one move I'd consider
RejectDrake: im only considering it because of rank difference lol
mark5000: lol
RejectDrake: to secure at least a spot
RejectDrake: before i crumble
mark5000: I also think about g6 and e3 and f3
]
(;B[ge]
C[mark5000: but g5 is maybe my first choice
]
(;W[gd]
C[RejectDrake: i used to do f3
RejectDrake: but it left me too much wide open
mark5000: it's a kind of hard game for black after that, but it's possible
RejectDrake: ye
RejectDrake: but with f3 i could easily predict the next move
mark5000: I played here because i need to get in the upper side or i lose
RejectDrake: typically g7
mark5000: right

C[RejectDrake: was that the right move?
RejectDrake: slash, should i have moved there?
mark5000: clamp is interesting but it left weaknesses in your shape
mark5000: without reading too much it seems i should be able to exploit the weaknesses and live somehow
mark5000: i'm not worried about my lower left group because it's fully enclosed for the time being.
mark5000: so i'll focus 100% on living the upper stone
RejectDrake: what would have been better?
mark5000: maybe hane h6
mark5000: it's not clear how white proceeds. From move 6: H6 
RejectDrake: f7 in that case?
]
(;B[fc]
C[mark5000: white is in a pickle, I think. From move 6: H6 F7 H7 
mark5000: there's no eyes up there. black swept them out.
RejectDrake: hmm
RejectDrake: true

C[RejectDrake: ðŸ˜® 
mark5000: Thanks
RejectDrake: My reading is horrible
RejectDrake: Gg
mark5000: Yeah, i agree about the reading
mark5000: How many steps do you look ahead?
RejectDrake: 3 at least
RejectDrake: When I try
RejectDrake: 3 at most
RejectDrake: When it looks simple
mark5000: Hm, thatâ€™s probably enough
RejectDrake: What went wrong?
RejectDrake: \[object Object\]
mark5000: Well, i can't oeave a long review now
