C[mark5000: gg
GrimChase: Thank you for the game. Oh, it got rather close in the end, but I think you were ahead most of the time.
mark5000: I took the non-optimal way at 26 because I could see a win easier
mark5000: I'm not sure how c3 would have turned out
GrimChase: I would have prefered that response. Although it still would have been hard for me, because you could have cut off my left group and it would have turned into a huge capturing race for the game.
mark5000: Yeah
mark5000: see you next time
GrimChase: I am looking forward to our next game. :3
