C[Kampinkarl1: I think it was the only way to make life but maybe I had enough liberty to attack. That's what I'm wondering. 
Kampinkarl1: Looking at it from my inexperienced eyes, i don't see a good way to aggress from there
Xaloc: I would agree, I have only seen for B to play B6 instead of D3!

C[Kampinkarl1: I think i evaluated every possible move (that I could think of) and D3 was the only way I saw to survive at that moment
