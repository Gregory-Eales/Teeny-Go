C[Fuseques: hmm
Fuseques: this is not the result
Enumaris: I felt like
Enumaris: I should do something about you probing but not following up
Enumaris: but it seems it was too slow 
Fuseques: what ruleset is this?
Enumaris: Chinese rules maybe
Enumaris: yeah Chinese
Enumaris: but I didn't fill extra dame either
Enumaris: if we fill dame it's 1 and 1 each anyways
Fuseques: its weird
Fuseques: ah.. i guess since chinese and 5.5 komi
Fuseques: usually 7.5
Enumaris: 5.5 komi is like 9x9 default here on ogs
Enumaris: I don't think they change the komi for ruleset
Enumaris: for 9x9
Enumaris: on 19x19 it's 7.5
Fuseques: with japanese counting and normal 6.5 its w + 2.5
Enumaris: I see
Fuseques: anyway
Enumaris: I'm getting one extra point cus I played first and u passed first
Enumaris: I guess
Enumaris: and then the other point is cus of komi
Fuseques: the idea of this probe is
Fuseques: now you wanna do something like thsi
Fuseques: and then i got this
Enumaris: uhm
Fuseques: if now
Enumaris: you're not in review
Enumaris: so I can't see what you're playing
Fuseques: fk
Fuseques: d1. From move 6: G4 H4 G3 C4 
Enumaris: XD
Fuseques: d2. From move 3: F6 G4 H4 G3 B5 B4 
Enumaris: yeah, if I leave the stone, u got c4 later
Fuseques: you still should though
Fuseques: too slow to capture
Enumaris: hmm
Fuseques: alright, gn
Enumaris: alright, thanks for the game :)
Enumaris: good night
