C[p616901748: thank you for the game
martin3141: thanks for the game
martin3141: where are you from?
martin3141: I am a bit puzzeled. Why did you play G1 and H2, especially as premoves? Also, I think D9 lost a point, but you won by 0.5 anyway. You appear to be present in the game all the time. It's almost as if I was playing a bot. I don't want to accuse you of cheating, but could you please put me at ease and explain?
p616901748: Sorry for G1 it was just fun
p616901748: yes you are right I counted and I was ahead anyway
p616901748: i check OGS very often and I use the conditional move feature a lot
martin3141: I see, sorry for suspecting you, and thanks for clarifying.
