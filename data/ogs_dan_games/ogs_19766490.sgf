C[pynxy: Thank you for the game.
mark5000: I should have taken G7 before you did, I think.
mark5000: I let that group live too comfortably..
mark5000: This didn't seem to work. From move 31: H8 G3 
pynxy: You shoul've played g4
mark5000: Looks better, yeah
pynxy: Instead of g3
pynxy: And you win by 0.5
mark5000: I think you're right. I considered it but G3 looked like better shape. I should adjust my thinking a little bit.
mark5000: For you I think the C6 attachment made a losing position had I played perfectly.
pynxy: Yeah, I think these 9x9 games are great for developing your sharpness
mark5000: D6 or other nearby placements should be recommended on the small board..
mark5000: See you next time.
pynxy: I just wanted to have some fun with c6
pynxy: see you
mark5000: It was :))
