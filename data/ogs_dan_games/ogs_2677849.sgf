C[mark5000: Cool
The Joker: Thnx
mark5000: It thought it was winning the whole game until you cut D3
The Joker: I didnt think he will fall for that
The Joker: Yeah i thought so too
mark5000: It didn't notice you could cut until after you filled the liberties with A7
The Joker: But that cut was something i had planned
mark5000: Then its win rate went from 33% to 64% in 2 moves.
The Joker: Yeah
mark5000: then 96 after two more.
The Joker: Why didnt he play c2 first?
The Joker: E2 didnt make much sense
mark5000: C2 would be better, but maybe it's already lost
mark5000: dead. From move 29: C2 C1 B1 A2 
The Joker: d1. From move 29: C2 C1 B1 A2 D1 E1 E2 C1 E3 B2 
The Joker: Oh we have the same variation
The Joker: Ok ty gg
mark5000: Yeah
mark5000: That's the reason
The Joker: What is the strongest level?
mark5000: 6d
The Joker: Stronger than u?
mark5000: ...yes. most of the time, anyway.
The Joker: Have u tried defeating him on that level?
mark5000: I can beat it more often in 9x9 though
The Joker: Yeah
mark5000: 19x19 is really hard
The Joker: Bots aren't that strong on 9x9
mark5000: They're stronger, in fact. The board is smaller so they can run more variations.
The Joker: Why isn't he on OGS?
mark5000: However,
mark5000: The bot scaling doesn't let it think much even on 6d level
mark5000: You can manually adjust it to think by time not level, then it's stronger than 6d on 9x9
The Joker: Stronger than ten?
mark5000: Maybe equal.
The Joker: Wow
mark5000: I would connect it to OGS. I have a spare PC. But I don't think it's a GTP engine
mark5000: It's got its own interface as a prebuilt software
The Joker: Hmm
mark5000: I don't think the engine is severable.
The Joker: U made him?
mark5000: No.
mark5000: I do not have the expertise or the will to do it.
Enumaris: got itself owned
Enumaris: lol
EonPiece: this would be better right?. From move 31: 
Enumaris: I'm surprised the bot misread this poorly
Enumaris: was it on purpose :D
Enumaris: c6 looked really weird
Enumaris: what was it's win rate against me? :D
Enumaris: at the end
Enumaris: when it resigned
EonPiece: at move 19, b6 would be better right?
Enumaris: left side group is already dead here I think. From move 29: 
Enumaris: This tesuji kills it I think?. From move 29: C2 A2 
Enumaris: isn't that a ko of some sort tho?
Enumaris: I thought A2 kills outright
EonPiece: i want to play with this bot too
Enumaris: at least I see no way to save it after A2
Enumaris: have you played the 6d version?
Enumaris: I can't beat bots on 9x9 very well
