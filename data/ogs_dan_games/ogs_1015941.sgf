C[mark5000: You already had the bottom area, so D3 was a slow move

C[TheRatchetCookie: Oh
TheRatchetCookie: But I didn't want you to separate my stones
mark5000: I get it
mark5000: Go is about good choices
TheRatchetCookie: What would be a good move here?
mark5000: Let me look
mark5000: Extending seems good
TheRatchetCookie: So c4?
mark5000: Make the weak stone stronger somehow
TheRatchetCookie: Oh
mark5000: Wrong stone
mark5000: C7 is weak

(;B[cd]
C[mark5000: That's better
TheRatchetCookie: K
mark5000: D7 might be even stronger because it strengthens your stone and also threatens to cut me. It's a dual purpose move

C[mark5000: You can win this fight!
mark5000: You can capture D8 stones
mark5000: Can you see how?
TheRatchetCookie: Oh ok
mark5000: It might be hard to see it b/c you're new
TheRatchetCookie: But is it better to capture d8 stones or separate at e5
mark5000: E5 is suicide
TheRatchetCookie: Oh nvm
mark5000: one liberty
TheRatchetCookie: I saw it
mark5000: Cool

(;B[bb]
C[mark5000: You have to avoid being captured first
TheRatchetCookie: There?
TheRatchetCookie: I think that group is dead now right?
mark5000: It would be. Can you see white's next move?
TheRatchetCookie: Umm
TheRatchetCookie: D6?

(;W[fb]
C[mark5000: Here, to catch your stone first
TheRatchetCookie: I would't know :P
TheRatchetCookie: So what should I do now?
mark5000: Now it's a "capturing race"
mark5000: But white has two liberties; black has one. So white is happy
mark5000: Try to capture at C9
mark5000: It's a forcing move
TheRatchetCookie: I was going to do f9

(;B[ca]
C[mark5000: F9 is suicide too. Maybe not right away, but I can cut it off.

(;W[ea]
C[TheRatchetCookie: Oh yeah
mark5000: You need to forget about the right side stones
TheRatchetCookie: I didn't see that
TheRatchetCookie: Lol
mark5000: Sounds familiar
TheRatchetCookie: So j3?
mark5000: The reason? The right side stones are behind enemy lines!
mark5000: H4 is stronger
]
(;B[hf]
C[mark5000: Make left and bottom territory
mark5000: You don't listen very well. I can relate!
mark5000: It surrounds more space than j3
mark5000: you can see that
TheRatchetCookie: Oh yeah
TheRatchetCookie: Derp
mark5000: Now you have a bigger corner area
TheRatchetCookie: So always surround as much space as possible
TheRatchetCookie: ?
mark5000: If it is safe. THat's very important
TheRatchetCookie: Ok

C[mark5000: I'm offering a trade here
mark5000: Do you take it or not?
mark5000: I'm saying:
TheRatchetCookie: I don't know what you mean :l
mark5000: You can revive the right side stones, but I'll capture the left side in return
mark5000: OR you can save the left and I'll capture the right
TheRatchetCookie: What side is stronger?
TheRatchetCookie: The left?
mark5000: Yes
mark5000: It's more stones
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
mark5000: So you should decline to trade
TheRatchetCookie: By?
mark5000: What's the best blocking move?
TheRatchetCookie: B6?
mark5000: B5
TheRatchetCookie: I was going to do that before
TheRatchetCookie: I didn't trust myself
]
(;B[be]
C[mark5000: Stops me completely. If b6, I can b5 and keep pushing
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
mark5000: But you see it now?
TheRatchetCookie: Yeah kind of
mark5000: I won't be happy if you just take my word for it. This game is for you
TheRatchetCookie: So b6 for you is suicidal right>
mark5000: d1. From move 21: B6 B5 A6 A5 A8 
TheRatchetCookie: Oh I see it now
mark5000: This could happen after b6, then the group is actually dead
TheRatchetCookie: Ok

(;W[bf]
C[mark5000: You have to make sure you can live
TheRatchetCookie: Why am I white now?
TheRatchetCookie: It shows a white stone
mark5000: analyze mode?
TheRatchetCookie: How do I get out?
mark5000: click back to game
mark5000: or reload the page
TheRatchetCookie: Ohhh
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
TheRatchetCookie: So now a5?
mark5000: Sure
HowToPlay?: Throw in. From move 21: B6 B5 A6 A5 A8 B9 A9 
HowToPlay?: Wasnt sure if he would know why its dead
HowToPlay?: so i showed the throw in
HowToPlay?: making a false eye

TheRatchetCookie: Where at?
mark5000: c4 or you cut my stone off
TheRatchetCookie: d4?
mark5000: For you? no, it's worth no points
TheRatchetCookie: I don't know what you mean by cut it off
TheRatchetCookie: Where at?
TheRatchetCookie: Where are you trying to connect?
mark5000: I connected it. So there's nothing there anymore
TheRatchetCookie: Oh
TheRatchetCookie: You meant you already did it
TheRatchetCookie: I was wondering
mark5000: I was explaining the move I made, yeah
TheRatchetCookie: Ok you confused me
mark5000: In case you were wondering
TheRatchetCookie: So a9 now?
TheRatchetCookie: Or a3?
mark5000: Playing inside your area? How about no
TheRatchetCookie: Oh yeah
TheRatchetCookie: I didn't see that
TheRatchetCookie: So a3?
mark5000: B3 would be more normal
mark5000: It's not the biggest move though
TheRatchetCookie: But I thought that was a slow move?
mark5000: Not in the last part of the game
TheRatchetCookie: Oh ok
]
(;B[bg]
C[mark5000: The moves start very big in the opening, then they get smaller and smaller until the moves are worth one point each. Then it's the end of the game

TheRatchetCookie: Why?
mark5000: D9 killed it 100%
mark5000: It's hard to explain.
TheRatchetCookie: Fine
mark5000: You don't have a way to make two eyes
mark5000: That's the easy answer
TheRatchetCookie: Oh
TheRatchetCookie: Because a9 is a false eye

C[mark5000: It's undecided.
TheRatchetCookie: Oh
TheRatchetCookie: Why is that?
TheRatchetCookie: Do the liberties have to touch?
mark5000: I can kill it. I have been able to kill it for several moves
mark5000: But if you play first, you could save it
TheRatchetCookie: By going to d6?
mark5000: And I can play B6 to capture two stones
