C[TheRatchetCookie: ...
mark5000: This is how.
TheRatchetCookie: Im a beginner
mark5000: Technically, white is dead from move 1
TheRatchetCookie: Where?
mark5000: I mean, with 7 stones, it should be impossible for white to make a living group anywhere
TheRatchetCookie: Hey I still got 24
mark5000: Yeah.
TheRatchetCookie: Rematch?
mark5000: With a smaller handicap!
mark5000: Than I can fix your mistakes without worrying too much
mark5000: I'll send a challenge.
HowToPlay?: plan on doing a full review?
