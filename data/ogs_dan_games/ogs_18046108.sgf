C[smurph: nope, autoscore still doesn't work properly xD
smurph: okie
smurph: now to make sure the dead are dead xD
smurph: evidently
smurph: next challenge: .5 game
smurph: with seki
smurph: i wish i could do that :P
smurph: creating seki by force is kinda hard
Alderi: The seki is considered seki at least
Alderi: That's a big improvement
Alderi: Well, if it passed, it means it could win even if the group was considered alive
Alderi: so in that regard the auto-score making a mistake isn't too much of an hassle
Alderi: I want to see that :D
