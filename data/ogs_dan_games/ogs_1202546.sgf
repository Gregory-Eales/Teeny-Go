C[mark5000: 6-3 is good. It's not my style, but it doesn't mean it's bad
mark5000: hi Fairstpierre
DeathTheKid101: okay, i'll still experiment with the  6-3 move, all type of opening seems like lots of fun :) and heyfair
DeathTheKid101: hey fair*
mark5000: you mean 5-3, right?
DeathTheKid101: yea, my mistake and 5-4 too
mark5000: feel free to check my library of pro games for 5-3 stuff
