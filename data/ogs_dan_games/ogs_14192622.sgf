C[martin3141: good game, thanks for playing
ReadyToGo!: I should have done something like this, am i right?. From move 22: D2 
martin3141: yeah, I think so
ReadyToGo!: ok, thanks for the confirmation
ReadyToGo!: do you any have other tips to share?
martin3141: maybe d5 wasn't best
martin3141: although it seems good, actually
ReadyToGo!: I can't have the stones on E5, E4 put on atari
ReadyToGo!: so E3? it looks a bit painful. From move 20: E3 D5 D6 
martin3141: f8 seems to solve a lot of my problems, though
ReadyToGo!: hm, I need to think about that suggestion
martin3141: what about extending here? . From move 18: H5 
ReadyToGo!: that's certainly not anything i had on the radar so gar!
ReadyToGo!: *far
ReadyToGo!: hm. From move 18: H5 D5 E3 F8 G7 G8 H7 D6 
martin3141: seems good for black. From move 18: H5 D5 E3 F8 G7 G8 H7 D6 D8 E8 B8 
ReadyToGo!: yea black seems be alive still
ReadyToGo!: then it should probably work
martin3141: maybe. From move 18: H5 D5 E3 H4 H6 G7 F8 H7 H8 J5 G8 J6 D6 D2 H2 
martin3141: well, hm ... it's complicated
martin3141: ^^
ReadyToGo!: if you say so ^^
martin3141: it's just, whenever a stone on 3rd line is in atari, my first instinct is to extend its liberties once
ReadyToGo!: ah
ReadyToGo!: interesting
martin3141: it's not always good though, so take it with a grain of salt ^^
ReadyToGo!: ^^
ReadyToGo!: Still interesting choice because I naturally would not consider that option in this case
martin3141: your suggestion. From move 22: D2 
martin3141: seems pretty good, all things considered
martin3141: anyway, I gotta go
martin3141: see you!
ReadyToGo!: could this work for black (based on your's). From move 18: H5 D5 E3 H4 G7 H6 H7 J5 D6 
ReadyToGo!: ah, alright!
ReadyToGo!: ok thanks for the input
ReadyToGo!: have a nice day
martin3141: yeah, looks good to me
martin3141: thanks, have a nice day
