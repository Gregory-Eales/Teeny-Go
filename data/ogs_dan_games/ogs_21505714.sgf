C[Xaloc: Sorry, that was mean, I know! ;-)

C[Snowonthetop: The game is already yours..
Snowonthetop: I‚Äôd appreciate if you could say what was my biggest mistake. 
Xaloc: Entschuldigung - Falschklick.
Xaloc: You plaid well, but forgot to build eyes and be careful with offering cuts!! That made it easier for me! and your last move H1 instead of J4 gave me another 2 pts!! Your start was ok,  I think  but you lost the trace what to do then with your stones, ok you connect them, that is correct 
Xaloc: but try to play better shape, what means a shape i.e. which can be later an eye
Xaloc: Try to get every point you can i.e. playing C9 is better for you, cause I now can play D9 another point for me.

C[Snowonthetop: Thanks a lot üôè
Snowonthetop: Actually I lost my control and since I thought you won already I did not count every points. 
Snowonthetop: I played h1 cause I thought it was necessary for 2-eye

(;B[ea]
C[Xaloc: But even when loosing and trying to play until the bitter end, try to gather as much pts as possible as an exercise. If you do a wrong move... so what, when you loose anyway. But next game you will remember perhaps

C[Xaloc: Now I have sente again, if you protect your stone and can destroy your maybe-eye above  Then J3 to reduce your eye in the corner... Play as much as possible,, 9x9 are really good to do and do not last so long ;-)
