C[swact: ty
quuxman: why not J4 at 33
quuxman: d1. From move 32: J4 H4 J5 F4 G4 
quuxman: I'm sure I'm missing something
quuxman: ah I see it makes no difference of course
dchawisher: wait, can you see my variations too? I'm not quite sure how this works
quuxman: use the share button
dchawisher: Yeah, I know -- I just realized that it made no difference at the same time you did, and I was wondering if you could see what I was doing
quuxman: nope
dchawisher: oh cool
quuxman: it's like a tsumego
dchawisher: d1. From move 32: J1 
dchawisher: can this kill white? what am I missing there?
quuxman: it's the same situation
quuxman: d2. From move 32: J1 F4 G4 J5 J4 J6 F1 E1 E4 J3 F4 
quuxman: that's not exactly the right exchange, but you get the idea
dchawisher: what if black plays at h4 instead of g4
quuxman: d3. From move 32: J1 F4 H4 J5 J4 J6 J3 H2 
dchawisher: dang, you're right
quuxman: btw, moving in the corner in any situation like this is bad, because it eliminates the potential for the simplest eye
dchawisher: yeah, I for some reason thought that killing those three would make up for it but I guess I miscounted
quuxman: I'm sure there's some case where you have to move in the corner, but usually you want to save it
quuxman: I guess the obvious case is if there's an enemy stone at H1 or J2
dchawisher: thank you!
