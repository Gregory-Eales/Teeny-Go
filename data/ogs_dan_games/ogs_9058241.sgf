p616901748: ungula
p616901748: I think the best reaction to a Hane in this situation is a Nobi on C5

p616901748: Nobi=malrapide

C[Komencanto: Nobi is a simple grow of a figure
Komencanto: Malrapide?
p616901748: but on 9x9 it is often the best move
p616901748: esperanto ;-)
Komencanto: Yes, I was glade to see you spaking Eo!
p616901748: One of my go teachers was Bio-mathematician
p616901748: and he allways said: Stones grow like plants#

(;B[gf]
C[Komencanto: Exactly!
Komencanto: like paints
p616901748: figures grow like plants from the corners and the sides
p616901748: in to the middle
Komencanto: And they die when they cannot grow
p616901748: where the sun is
p616901748: yes:- )
p616901748: do you know: The middle is called tengen
p616901748: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tengen 
p616901748: the holy center of heaven
Komencanto: tengen is the point or land?
p616901748: the E5
p616901748: middle star point
p616901748: the marked points are the star points
Komencanto: Now I see
p616901748: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Hoshi
Komencanto: G4 was good?
p616901748: Star points and Hoshishit the small stars
p616901748: it comes from the ancient china, when go was used for astronomy and zodiacal fortune telling
p616901748: you understand?
p616901748: Now you played G4
Komencanto: Doog idea?
Komencanto: Good
p616901748: it is a contact move
p616901748: Kosumi in Japanes
p616901748: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Attachment
p616901748: it is not allways a good Idea
p616901748: because it makes the opponent strong

p616901748: because I like it so
p616901748: My teachers allways say, it is not possible to save every stone
p616901748: and sometimes, one uses single stones to sacrifice

C[p616901748: chinese counting
p616901748: 14 stones + 5.5 Komi
p616901748: and you: 12 Stones?
p616901748: again please
p616901748: I saw your invitation
Komencanto: 81 - 39 = 42
Komencanto: Newtral point is impossible
Komencanto: neutral
p616901748: yes
p616901748: but why 42?
Komencanto: 39+42=81 - the hole matrix
p616901748: but why 39?
Komencanto: The mission is to divide the matrix
Komencanto: 39? May be I made mistake
p616901748: yes
p616901748: you have 29
p616901748: and I have 26
Komencanto: Empty!
p616901748: but you have 12 Stones
Komencanto: 26 of empty
p616901748: and I have 12 Stones
p616901748: both counting methods have the same result allways
Komencanto: Not always
p616901748: ????
p616901748: okay
p616901748: can you prove it mathematically?
p616901748: ;-)
Komencanto: Becouse the black can make tha last move
p616901748: n area scoring, your score is:      the number of your stones on the board and     the number of empty points your stones surround 
p616901748: ahhhh!
Komencanto: Yes!
p616901748: now I see: you have 12+29
p616901748: and I have 14+26
Komencanto: Yes
p616901748: But black can make the first move, so that white gets +5.5 points
p616901748: so I win with 4,5 points
p616901748: allrigth! :-D
Komencanto: Your move was last
p616901748: ?
p616901748: yes
Komencanto: So the nuber of stones is equal
Komencanto: number
p616901748: and the two captured stones do not count
p616901748: I captured two!
p616901748: 2
p616901748: so I have two more, very clever counting
