C[Vivian_Vex: Now I know I can't play safe
Kaworu Nagisa: ok
Vivian_Vex: Or at least I am going to assume that based on rank difference
Vivian_Vex: Which makes me want to play right here.

C[Vivian_Vex: Thank you for the game.
Kaworu Nagisa: thanks
Vivian_Vex: That
Vivian_Vex: Was so much fun!
Vivian_Vex: Thank you for this ^_^
Kaworu Nagisa: i was struggling to find a working sequence if you played here. From move 16: H2 
Vivian_Vex: I thought this would just be a boring night but nope!
Kaworu Nagisa: yeah, it got a little too tesne for my liking lol
Vivian_Vex: I looked at something like that
Vivian_Vex: I thought you would do this (Getting varriation)
Kaworu Nagisa: theres enough weaknes in your shapes that there should be something but
Kaworu Nagisa: couldnt find it
Vivian_Vex: Nevermind. I played through it more and it worked for me
Vivian_Vex: And yeah T_T 
Vivian_Vex: I really needed to make it stronger than I thought it needed to be at the end
Kaworu Nagisa: i should have just played here.. From move 7: C4 
Vivian_Vex: That's usually what gets me in these big games.
Kaworu Nagisa: ah
Kaworu Nagisa: yeah
Kaworu Nagisa: well you had weird shape in the opening
Vivian_Vex: I always think I'm more safe than I am
Kaworu Nagisa: but i guess its 9x9, so  awkward shape is ok
Vivian_Vex: Which shape in the opening?
Kaworu Nagisa: this. From move 8: 
Vivian_Vex: OH yeah, I would usually never play E7 lol
Kaworu Nagisa: thats the kind of thing that wouldnt be good in 19x19
Vivian_Vex: With this set up
Vivian_Vex: But as I said I couldn't play it safe I felt.
Kaworu Nagisa: well
Kaworu Nagisa: you should still have a purpose for moves like that
Vivian_Vex: I did
Kaworu Nagisa: thought you were going to go for this. From move 6: D8 D7 E6 C8 F8 D9 G8 
Vivian_Vex: To try to force you more against the wall and maybe snag the top right corner.
Vivian_Vex: Nah, E7 became a stone I could use to threaten but sacrifice 
Kaworu Nagisa: ok
Vivian_Vex: Like G7
Vivian_Vex: For if I wanted to move up
Vivian_Vex: This is what lost me the game I think. From move 29: 
Kaworu Nagisa: well, i was really happy to get H2
Kaworu Nagisa: this would be really bad for white. From move 15: H2 F3 H3 H1 
Kaworu Nagisa: id only have like 10 points + komi
Vivian_Vex: THis is what I was afraid of if I didn't play F4
Kaworu Nagisa: really? i think black wins here
Vivian_Vex: White does. I just didn't read far enough ahead
Kaworu Nagisa: white cant block. From move 15: H2 F3 H3 H1 H6 G7 H7 H8 F8 G8 J7 J2 J3 J5 
Kaworu Nagisa: white cant even live. From move 15: H2 F3 H3 H1 H6 G7 H7 H8 
Vivian_Vex: I am going to study the hell out of this game.
Kaworu Nagisa: so i bascially ahd to play F3, nothing else worked, and this *might* work
Vivian_Vex: One of these days I WILL beat a Dan! Though today is not that day lol Anyway it os getting late so I should head off.
Kaworu Nagisa: it was almost today...
Kaworu Nagisa: ok, nite nite
Vivian_Vex: Thank you again!
Vivian_Vex: And yeah, almost!
Kaworu Nagisa: for sure
Kaworu Nagisa: cya
Vivian_Vex: People say it's not good because you get cut but honestly black usually needs two groups to win anyway.
Vivian_Vex: Yeah
Vivian_Vex: Also if I just played C3 he could have just played E6
Vivian_Vex: nono
Vivian_Vex: I was talking about the move I made
Vivian_Vex: Toooo tired
Vivian_Vex: Bed now
Vivian_Vex: You remember those 2 mistakes? Yeah
Vivian_Vex: I know what I messed up with in this game because I went through and studied it like mad lol
Vivian_Vex: I was
Vivian_Vex: And yeah
Vivian_Vex: I was also trying to not play safe
Vivian_Vex: IE: E7
Vivian_Vex: Exactly
Vivian_Vex: I had it set up as a sacrifice stone
Vivian_Vex: G7
Vivian_Vex: When playing against Dans at our level playing safe will just lead to a loss.
Vivian_Vex: You're missing the point. G7 and help me eitehr capture Whites group at bottom right or get the top right
Vivian_Vex: Every single point matters and if I could have even gotten 4  points by using G7 as a forcing move it would have been worth it.
Vivian_Vex: he already had the corner
Vivian_Vex: It doesn't matter if it's big. It matters if it gives me points.
Vivian_Vex: Yeah either he killed it or I forced him to kill it and give myself another move.
Vivian_Vex: If he didn't the top right would have been mine for sure
Vivian_Vex: Move 2 is utterly useless. That's why you fail to see. :P
Vivian_Vex: here. From move 7: G3 F8 
Vivian_Vex: Not looking good for White top left. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 D3 B6 
Vivian_Vex: And exhange that is incredibly costly
Vivian_Vex: Are we gonna do this right now?. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 D3 B6 B7 B8 
Vivian_Vex: Because that's already almost Komi I get back and more than half the board
Vivian_Vex: I would play here. Try and keep him small.. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 B5 H4 D3 C3 
Vivian_Vex: The inside is very rarely worth points 
Vivian_Vex: Well it's still invadeable even
Vivian_Vex: TOO TIRED FOR THIS
Vivian_Vex: GOING TO BED NOW
Vivian_Vex: NIGHT
mekriff: I hear most people do this, but what you did was OK too I think. From move 2: E7 
mekriff: if you're going to abandon, don't make w strong first. From move 6: C3 
mekriff: they say it's not good for that?
mekriff: this cut is worthless. From move 2: E7 E6 D6 F6 D5 D7 
mekriff: ponnuki isn't as effective as normal. From move 6: C3 E6 F6 D7 G3 
mekriff: this is absolutely the direction you needed. From move 16: F2 
mekriff: on 9x9, or at least with dans, you need to read like a madman during the game
mekriff: any big mistakes will ruin the game absolutely
mekriff: why F4, though? That's not a move I would even consider?
mekriff: E7 can die, it's useless
mekriff: you don't get much from the sacrifice
mekriff: or at least not in the opening it was played in
mekriff: only if w plays the gote move you were worried about does the sacrifice become big
mekriff: I'm not seeing G7 as an effective forcing move for either of those
mekriff: not as big as a corner
mekriff: and if w plays a corner, you can still get F7 in later
mekriff: move order matters, though
mekriff: I'd be thankful w even responded to F6
mekriff: I fail to see how. From move 7: G3 D8 D7 
mekriff: this maybe, but w gets sente at the bottom. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 
mekriff: seems good for w. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 D3 
mekriff: it's an exchange. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 D3 B6 B7 
mekriff: nvm I saw the killing variation
mekriff: so I guess something like this is more likely. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 B5 F3 F2 E3 G4 
mekriff: or you played something else
mekriff: that's far from the small I imagined
mekriff: ok
mekriff: w 19.5 b20. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 B5 H4 D3 C3 H3 E3 E2 D2 F3 E4 F1 J3 G4 H5 J2 J4 H1 C6 B6 D7 C8 C5 A2 B2 A3 E9 D9 F9 G5 H7 D1 C2 B1 C1 E1 A1 B4 B3 A4 B1 
mekriff: w 17.5 b20. From move 7: G3 F8 D8 C4 B5 H4 D3 C3 H3 E3 E2 D2 F3 E4 F1 J3 G4 H5 J2 J4 H1 C6 B6 D7 C8 C5 A2 B2 A3 E9 D9 F9 G5 H7 D1 C2 B1 A4 B4 B3 A5 C1 E1 A1 B7 A4 A3 A2 A4
