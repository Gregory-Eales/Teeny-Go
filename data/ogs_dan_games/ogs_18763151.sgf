C[Valkyria9: It had the impression my program knew what it could simplify so winrate just increased with 3-5% each move. was doing most of the time and had some room to simplify like this. But there was no bad moves
Valkyria9: THanks for the game!
Valkyria9: I would like to edit that sentence but hope it is understandable anyway...
mark5000: I understand it. I had the line figured to B+1.5 before the match, and Odin made no lossy moves. If it found no mistakes by me, the reason for losing could be low komi or the d4 opening line resolves to B+1.5 too simply.
