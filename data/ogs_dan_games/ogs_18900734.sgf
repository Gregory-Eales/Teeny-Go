C[mark5000: Thanks.
Deep Scholar: Good Game
Deep Scholar: tough one
mark5000: Yeah, DS seems good at making non-life in a corner but keeping presure up so it doesn't matter.
Deep Scholar: e6 was tough move for as I wasn't sure how the top shape would form
mark5000: It was.
mark5000: I got a killing shape but not enough space in the LL to pull it off, thanks to a good ko
mark5000: Congrats on 3 wins and the title. I will try my best in the others.
Deep Scholar: had to think for a while after g7 just to figure out where to invade
Deep Scholar: thank you I'm sure you will make it tough on me.
