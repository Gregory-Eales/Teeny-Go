C[mark5000: Hey!
RejectDrake: Hi
RejectDrake: So
RejectDrake: Can you tell me how each stone has purpose, and how? Also, what they mean
mark5000: That's a pretty tall order to say what each of your stones means!
mark5000: I think you would know the meaning of your own moves, or you wouldn't play them.
mark5000: For me, e5 is a good first move. 9x9 is often a kind of big fight, and e5 exerts influence in all directions at once. It's an ideal fighting position.

C[mark5000: I think you can guess my purpose with c3
RejectDrake: Getting a corner?
RejectDrake: Is c6 a good defense? If it is, what is better?

(;B[cd]
C[mark5000: c3 was about getting a corner, right. I'll get another one here.

C[RejectDrake: But c6
mark5000: Your c6 was good. Since you played it, I don't have much else to say.
RejectDrake: Good or bad or freat
RejectDrake: Great*
mark5000: It was perfect. I might play it too.
RejectDrake: How does it compare to other moves?
mark5000: The opening is your strongest go skill.
RejectDrake: From here I usually play g5
mark5000: c5 is also popular. c6 is weaker against my c3 but stronger against any invasion like g7.
RejectDrake: How does that compare to others?
mark5000: g5 looks good.
RejectDrake: So this is better?. From move 2: G4 
mark5000: c6 is probably stronger, like you played.
mark5000: But it's a small difference, you know? The opening doesn't matter as much as the fighting.
RejectDrake: Against the c3, and tengen, what is a better positioning?
mark5000: Sorry to confuse you. After tengen and c3 nothing is better than c6. I said it's a perfect move. I don't know that for certain, but it's one of the moves I might play, definitely.
mark5000: I thought the strongest moves were c5 and c6, and one isn't better than the other in my opinion.
RejectDrake: Oh ok
RejectDrake: So
mark5000: If I can offer criticism, I think you worry too much about first moves. You should focus on the endgame moves if you want to improve.
RejectDrake: After g7 I consider g5
mark5000: Great
mark5000: I might play g5 too
RejectDrake: Oh, I focus on my openings first
RejectDrake: I consider them to be extremely important 
RejectDrake: Because the first few moves can basically determine the entire game on 9x9
RejectDrake: Are there better moves than g5?

(;B[ge]
C[mark5000: I see where you're coming from.
mark5000: The opening sets the tone of the game, and it can make or break a high-level game.
RejectDrake: Ye
mark5000: But I think at the kyu levels the endgame is more important. If you miss an important cut or misread a life and death situation, a perfect opening won't save you.
mark5000: For move 5, I thought about e3 and g5.

C[RejectDrake: Comments on E3
RejectDrake: Apparently it’s way too greedy
RejectDrake: From here I do E3
mark5000: Sure, that looks good.
RejectDrake: Are there any other moves to consider?
RejectDrake: Better ones or ones on the same level
mark5000: I'd look at c7 too
RejectDrake: From here, moves to consider?. From move 3: E3 
RejectDrake: Oh, how long is the opening typically?
RejectDrake: And isn’t c7 a little slow?
mark5000: How is c7 slow?
RejectDrake: 1. From move 6: C7 F3 
mark5000: There should be some counterplay in the upper right corner after that, so it's probably sente.
RejectDrake: 2. From move 6: C7 F3 
RejectDrake: So
RejectDrake: For this game
RejectDrake: I’d like to perfect my openings
mark5000: 3. From move 6: C7 F3 D8 E8 E7 F8 H6 H7 
mark5000: It seems like Black can push White into a small area. Maybe it's ok for both.
mark5000: e3 is ok too
RejectDrake: F3?
mark5000: f3 looks conservative next to g5.
RejectDrake: Ok
RejectDrake: So E3 is best?
mark5000: I have no idea. I'm human. All I can say is it's one of the moves I'd consider playing.
Joshuaplays: hi
Joshuaplays: mark5000, i actually saw some of your puzzles for beginners and i must say, their pretty good.

C[mark5000: If you want to know best moves, ask AlphaGo.
RejectDrake: AlphaGo?

(;B[fd]
C[mark5000: Bots are stronger than humans on all board sizes. I can teach you how to think better and play a better game, but I can't tell you what move is absolutely strongest.

(;W[eh]
C[RejectDrake: Who’s AlphaGo?
mark5000: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo
RejectDrake: Oh
RejectDrake: How do I use it?
mark5000: Well, you can't. And I'm pretty certain AlphaGo plays only 19x19. I was being sarcastic in suggesting it. The point was humans don't know what moves are absolutely best in the opening. Bots are better at that, but only God really knows what moves are best. Perfect play is a mystery in Go. It's not a solved game.
RejectDrake: True
RejectDrake: But
mark5000: All I can do is offer advice on improving your game. It's up to you to listen to me or not. That's fine too.
RejectDrake: There is possible perfect openings
mark5000: Sounds like you're set in your ways, TBH.

C[RejectDrake: Seemed like an ok move to me
RejectDrake: Then again
RejectDrake: I’m bad at reading
mark5000: I don't think Black can cut anywhere

C[mark5000: Yeah, I think so. But you can improve it!
mark5000: More experience reading and playing games will help
