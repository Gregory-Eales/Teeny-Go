C[mark5000: gg
Inven: good game
mark5000: guess it was bad for me
mark5000: But not as disastrous as feared
Inven: It would not have been if I did not find H6
Inven: Instead of H4, F8 would have been good
mark5000: Maybe it was the wrong order to play H4 before F8
mark5000: Yeah
mark5000: I thought there was no difference
Inven: Yeah I almost didn't either
Inven: Something felt off and I read as much as I could 
Inven: Jason
mark5000: E3 was really interesting
Inven: G7 does not solve H6
Inven: After G7 I play H7 and he should resign there
Inven: E3, let me find that
mark5000: not enough liberties here. From move 23: G7 H7 G8 H8 
Inven: Oh move 7?
mark5000: maybe here is better. From move 7: H5 
mark5000: I couldn't think about how to answer, and my move seemed not to be very powerful
Inven: I can't see your variations, if I hover over the blue text I can't see the board
mark5000: Oh, ok
mark5000: you can click them maybe
Inven: In response to E3
Inven: H5 is the best response
mark5000: Probably hane instead of push up
Inven: Oh clicking works
mark5000: Yeah, h5 was the other of the two moves I considered.
Inven: Anything but H5 there loses
mark5000: Seems so
Inven: Which is why I play it when I can
mark5000: opening is really important to get right on this board size
Inven: Yeah
mark5000: one innacuracy and you could be a goner
mark5000: I don't think you gave me a chance to recover
Inven: For some reason, I felt like tengen this game
Inven: Yeah, have to be relentless on 9x9
mark5000: And on 19x19. And in life.
Inven: In 19x19 I feel less scared to be passive at times
Inven: 9x9, I can barely look away because I feel like I need to keep reading
mark5000: I'm relentless in beating eggs for a good scramble :)
Inven: That is always good
mark5000: Thanks for another game. Seems I can't figure you out yet
Inven: I personally eat fried
Inven: We can play another if you want
mark5000: 3 of 5 then I'm out
mark5000: nigiri for color
Inven: sure
Inven: that means random instead of automatic right
mark5000: yes
mark5000: Interesting the point loss was within 1 point. If you're true 6d (whatever that means) then I'm 4d in 9x9, which seems about right.
Jason5: but H6 can solved by g7
Jason5: can be
