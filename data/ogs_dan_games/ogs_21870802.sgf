C[Knight-Hawk: ty gg
Utaha: gg
Utaha: learned for five years
Utaha: when I was in elementary school
Utaha: Idk I was in Asia and there are GO school there
Utaha: Not the case for me
Utaha: I have no idea
Utaha: when the game end
Utaha: by end it means both u and ur opponent cannot gained any territory
Utaha: for example in this game
Utaha: I occupy the lower part while the white got the upper part
Utaha: we realize that it's impossible to invade others territory
Utaha: because the space is too small for a living
Utaha: yes
Utaha: yes
Utaha: exactly
Utaha: a basic concept is the "eyes"
Utaha: \[object Object\]
Utaha: you need like this to survive
Utaha: but no one is that stupid to let u put those chess freely
Utaha: indeed
Cowtarded: how long have you been playing
Cowtarded: if I wanted to learn
Cowtarded: is there a tutorial or a anything
Cowtarded: I need to play someone who knows I'm new and will explain things, but that is hard.
Cowtarded: I don't know anyone, maybe you can recommend a website?
Cowtarded: How do you know
Cowtarded: when to "pass?"
Cowtarded: yeah but why not keep going then?
Cowtarded: Does the game automatically recognize that and end the game?
Cowtarded: This website I mean.
Cowtarded: Because you'll just capture
Cowtarded: his pieces?
Cowtarded: if he tries
Cowtarded: I "understand" the game
Cowtarded: I've just never once played it.
Cowtarded: I really love chess.
Cowtarded: Go looked awesome.
Cowtarded: I've heard of the "eyes" 
Cowtarded: well
Cowtarded: I would
Cowtarded: because I don't know what to do
Cowtarded: I mean I just "need to make the mistake" once.
Cowtarded: To really feel it in play.
Cowtarded: I see why not to do it.. but moving through the steps might be a different thing.
