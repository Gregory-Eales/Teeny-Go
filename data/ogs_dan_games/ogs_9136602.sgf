C[mark5000: Thanks
mark5000: And congrats
Valkyria9: Thanks, actually this was a hard position for Valkyria because it tends to prune important moves in the search tree and it takes a long time to find the right move and/or evaluate correctly. I am still confused myself. There was no easy games in this match even with black.
