C[Valkyria9: Valkyria thinks a lot of move are playable here. Could be a sign of confusion

C[mark5000: If Valkyria is trying to live the dead group, then yeah, I think so. The variation I'm expecting ends in W+0.5.

C[Valkyria9: I should resign but, I am trying to find out why Valkyria thinks it helps having a ko shape. Maybe a good test position for MC-programs.

C[mark5000: Yeah, that's interesting. I'm not sure why it thinks so. I thought it might just be postponing the loss.
Valkyria9: I cannot explain exactly why evaluation is bad, but in principle Valkyria avoid playing the simple move that captures the lower right stones in the search tree. It is probablz the All Moves As First heuristic that does not work in this position. If I plaz for example white J5 and then let it search it sees quickly that it will lose. 
Valkyria9: Thanks for the game, and a good match! You put some really hard pressure on the Valkyria in most of the games!
mark5000: Thanks and congratulations! Was very fun.
