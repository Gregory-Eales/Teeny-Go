C[mark5000: There was nothing to gain from b7. I have to play around A7 later anyway.

C[dexy: black cannkt resist. From move 40: D1 C1 E1 H6 H4 H7 H8 H9 
dexy: black cannot resist. From move 40: D1 C1 E1 H6 H4 H7 H8 H9 
dexy: Actually aiming at black mistake shown in upper diagram is what white would hope for. Black B7 is sente and tesuji not enough for black to secure white cut in above diagram. B7 and G2 secure black's win.
dexy: other option for white, black wins too. From move 17: E1 F1 D1 F2 D9 D3 C2 D6 D7 E5 E9 F9 F6 F5

C[mark5000: In hindsight, I think move 4 was too soft. Maybe something more aggressive like
mark5000: this is better. From move 3: D4 
mark5000: Or the same at c5
