C[mark5000: Hello.
JackTIM: Alright. I'm also learning to maneuver around the site too... Heh... 
mark5000: Okay
JackTIM: Hi.
mark5000: You know what the game is about?
mark5000: I assume you know how to capture stones
JackTIM: Yeah. I have the basic concepts down. But I can't seem to play the strategy very well.
mark5000: Okay
mark5000: The name "go" isn't very helpful.
mark5000: In China, it's called "surrounding game"
mark5000: That name tells you the game is about surrounding territory
mark5000: The player who surrounds the most territory is the winner
JackTIM: Right. You want to cover and surround as much territory as possible without leaving yourself open to being taken.
mark5000: Exactly
JackTIM: And preferably with as few stones as possible.
mark5000: For the opening, any move on the third or fourth lines or in the center is good.
mark5000: Right
mark5000: You stake a claim to some lower left territory

C[mark5000: Right
mark5000: You stake a claim to some lower left territory

(;W[fe]
C[mark5000: I'll grab some right side territory
]
(;B[fc]
C[mark5000: That's a good move too
mark5000: You're saying I can't go up
mark5000: But I can split you apart and make you struggle a bit.
mark5000: This is because the stones are not connected. They are so far apart. But that's okay for now
]
(;W[de]
C[mark5000: This is a splitting move. I think you can understand it
mark5000: I'm saying you have to get enough space on top and bottom to win
JackTIM: Yeah. I think my best choice would be to form a wall and bring my stones closer together... Like... C5 maybe?
mark5000: It's a good idea
]
(;B[ce]
C[mark5000: The stone was a little weak, so it's good to make it stronger
mark5000: Beginners don't appreciate weak stones really
mark5000: Weak means susceptible to attack.

(;W[dd]
C[mark5000: I will continue splitting.

(;B[ec]
C[mark5000: Divide and conquer is a good strategy in this game

C[mark5000: Your sense of play seems fine already
]
(;W[fg]
C[JackTIM: I think it may be my mid/end game that's fouling me up.
mark5000: Maybe. You're doing a good job making life on the bottom
mark5000: To live with a group of stones, you need to maximize the space inside
JackTIM: I know well enough that if I play dead center or F4 you'll probably capture the stone on the next move.
]
(;B[eh]
C[mark5000: It's interesting. If you play f4 (a bad move) I would play g3. You still can't save the stone, but it's a more helpful spot for me.
mark5000: Actually, nevermind
mark5000: You can just capture, obviously

(;W[fh]
C[mark5000: Do you know this shape?
mark5000: d1. From move 16: 
mark5000: For this shape, there is a vital point in the center
mark5000: It's a headache for black if white gets the move
JackTIM: Okay, that's cool that you can see what's being notated on hover over.
JackTIM: It's got an "x" at C2. What's that mean? "Don't play here"?
mark5000: That is the vital point
mark5000: If you imagine a white stone there, it's hard to answer
mark5000: Black normally takes it for himself for a good solid position
mark5000: See here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?MouthShape
JackTIM: Okay, so I should place one there to stop your cutting potential.
mark5000: Right. It's the instinctual move for all strong players
JackTIM: You could still come in and try and run along 3 or D, but it's a hard spot to kee.
JackTIM: *keep.

C[mark5000: Now I'm pushing the right side border.

(;B[fb]
C[mark5000: You could be more aggressive here. G8 was stronger.
mark5000: Remember: to live you have to maximize the space inside

(;W[gb]
(;B[ga]
C[mark5000: I can kill the top group now.
mark5000: d2. From move 21: 
mark5000: White can sneak in and destroy the space inside

(;W[ha]
(;B[cc]
C[mark5000: Good. I can't reduce the space anymore
mark5000: This is how to manage your groups

(;W[bd]
(;B[ad]
C[mark5000: Where would you play as white to attack the black stone?
JackTIM: I would imagine F9 for a quick capture. It's in atari if I remember how that works correctly.
mark5000: The left stone, I mean. I can put that into atari too
mark5000: Then what happens? You escape, and I chase you into the wall.
mark5000: One more reason the move is not good: It does not stop white from moving up or moving down
JackTIM: A7 or A5, I would think A7 would be better because it runs me down and behind the d1 from before.
mark5000: It's better to block white's direction one way than try for both.

(;W[bc]
C[mark5000: Now I can just move up and keep pressure on your top group
]
(;B[be]
C[mark5000: I can kill your top group again. Do you see? Black won't have enough space inside if white just moves up again
]
(;W[fd]
(;B[ea]
C[mark5000: Did you see the problem before?
mark5000: Let me show you.
mark5000: d3. From move 27: 
mark5000: If white moves this way, the group is pretty much surrounded and dead.
mark5000: so black should have blocked.
mark5000: d4. From move 28: B8 
mark5000: Remember: black needs to maximize the space to make life
mark5000: Or you will lose a lot of stones in your games

(;B[bb]
(;W[ac]
C[mark5000: Do you need another move on the top to live?
JackTIM: A8?
mark5000: Correct
]
(;B[ab]
C[mark5000: The reason is straightforward. You just want to maximize the space. It's a fundamental principle.
]
(;W[ei]
C[JackTIM: So B9 would have been an alright move, but my best choice was A8.
mark5000: Yes. B9 is three points worse. You can count it easily.
mark5000: 7 points. From move 33: 
mark5000: 4 points. From move 32: B9 A8 C8 
JackTIM: Okay, for this move, I'm thinking D1. Your nearest moves would be put immediately into atari.
mark5000: Correct

(;B[di]
(;W[fi]
C[mark5000: I need to save the stone or you will take it and creep into my area
JackTIM: Okay, I can't easily cut. So here I should focus on attacking or fortifying.
mark5000: It is the endgame
JackTIM: So I should pass?
mark5000: In the endgame, you're looking to seal the borders and squeeze one point here and one point there
mark5000: It's not time to pass yet because there's still one-point moves
mark5000: For example e1
mark5000: sorry, e6
mark5000: if white gains e6, e5 is a point for white
mark5000: if black e6, white has to connect and there's no point for white anymore
]
(;B[ed]
(;W[ee]
C[mark5000: That's an example of endgame move
mark5000: There's two places left
mark5000: A5 and F9
mark5000: You can see why, I'm sure

C[JackTIM: Yeah. So I was in a position that I just had to choose which side I was going to lose those points on. 
mark5000: Exactly
mark5000: Good game
mark5000: You have the most trouble living with your weak groups. I would focus on making sure each group has enough space to survive.
mark5000: I hope you understand how to play better now
JackTIM: A little bit. 
mark5000: lol
JackTIM: This game is a bit more multifaceted than the games I'm used to playing.
mark5000: There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's because it's an eastern kind of game.
mark5000: But it's also really fun and easy to watch.
JackTIM: Yeah, a friend of mine plays. That's how I got into it. But I just haven't caught on all that well yet.
mark5000: If you want to get stronger fast, try the puzzles link on the sidebar.
mark5000: There's a great little collection for beginners at the top
JackTIM: Alright. Thanks for your help! I'll see what kind of trouble I can get into now.
mark5000: Haha. Good luck!
mark5000: bye
JackTIM: Bye!
