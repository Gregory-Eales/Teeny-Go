EonPiece: eh, you cant look down upon 9x9
Kaworu Nagisa: i mean 5.5 is a lot on 9x9
Kaworu Nagisa: its not like 5.5 on 19x19
EonPiece: hey there was a debate if 5.5 was enough
EonPiece: people argued that it wasn't
Kaworu Nagisa: peopel have argued for the same with 19x19
Kaworu Nagisa: the goal isn't to make it clsoe you know
Kaworu Nagisa: especially against a peaceful, counting player
Kaworu Nagisa: i dont care about winning by 40 points
EonPiece: yeah, but even on 9x9 they said it wasn't enogh and should be 6.5 ><
Kaworu Nagisa: 0.5 is enough, and if i can guarnatee a win, ill let you get away with whatever you want
EonPiece: heh?
Kaworu Nagisa: you shoudlnt be trying to argue your way to thinkign yuo did better, nor can you really convince yourself you did better whent he score is the same
