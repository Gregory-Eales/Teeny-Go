C[Inven: I am not losing but I am sad I missed C4
mark5000: Yeah, this ain't happening
mark5000: What's in C4? That was desperation >.>
Inven: It was a strong move
Inven: In my mind I had the game
Inven: Sort of had to re-adjust after C4
Inven: Guess you could say it was an explosive move
mark5000: gg
Inven: good game
mark5000: It didn't profit anything.
Inven: I expected E2
mark5000: Do you have a sequence in mind?
Inven: It was when you played C2 that you blundered very hard
Inven: sequence I expected from E2 or optimal from C4?
mark5000: from C4
Inven: C4 C5 H9
