C[Elmindreda_Go: Actually, is that seki?
p616901748: oh no 
p616901748: yes it is a seki clearly
Elmindreda_Go: I think i won either way though
Elmindreda_Go: But my counting isnt great
Elmindreda_Go: Uuuhh..
p616901748: mh
Elmindreda_Go: Crud.. I could call mod
p616901748: yes please
p616901748: the counting is not correct
Elmindreda_Go: Mod called
p616901748: thank you
Elmindreda_Go: Asked in chat too, because last time i used the call mod feature was 3 days ago and still waiting for someone to show up there
p616901748: ok
Elmindreda_Go: Hopefully someone comes to look at this
p616901748: I did not look at the counting and clicked the button because I was so sure that it was marked as a Seki
p616901748: It is a close win for black +0.5 points
p616901748: But in the end it is my fault, because I accepted the counting, sorry
Elmindreda_Go: im counting Black 21, white 21.5
Elmindreda_Go: Assuming there are no points in the area with seki
Elmindreda_Go: But im not sure how to count the seki
p616901748: black and white have one point 
p616901748: so it doues not change the score
p616901748: Black 22
p616901748: 16 Ter + 6 Pris.
p616901748: White 13 ter + 4 Pris + 5.5 Kom
p616901748: White 22.5
Elmindreda_Go: Ok, yea
Elmindreda_Go: Fun and very close game. I think I would definitely have lost without a8
p616901748: yes
Elmindreda_Go: I almost played a6 instead
Elmindreda_Go: But then you could have played a8
Elmindreda_Go: But yea, somehow i doubt a mod will be here soon,but i'll leave the mod call open so that someone can fix the scoring here eventually
p616901748: ok
Elmindreda_Go: Thanks for the game. Im up for rematch if you want
RyukBaduk: hes my buddy paul from Germany :)
