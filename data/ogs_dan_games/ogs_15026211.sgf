C[Melonazox: sory mis read :)
Melonazox: thx for the game
Melonazox: i had to play at g3 now you make 2 eyes
Neandertaler: I'm a little bit lucky, I didn't expect it to get so close.
Neandertaler: I think D6 instead of E6 would have been better for you. because you can cut in sente, not in fote as in the game.
Neandertaler: *gote
