C[Inven: good game
mark5000: gg
Inven: It is too bad climbing the ladder is taking forever :c
mark5000: lol, yeah
mark5000: challenge other people who play fast
mark5000: :)
Inven: Yeah that's what I'm trying, still don't know many 9x9 players
mark5000: I think my B6 was wrong
Inven: Basically just you, me and the Canadian Go Association President
mark5000: I assumed you'd defend it
Inven: move 29 J7 was quite bad
mark5000: Sadaharu is also very good at 9x9
mark5000: Was J8 better? I thought they were equal
Inven: and move 15 j3
Inven: At move 15 I felt confident, at move 29 I had the game
Inven: Move 29, should have done C4
Inven: I would still be winning, but you were not to be counted out
mark5000: J3 is an only-move though
Inven: F7 for more 15
mark5000: \[object Object\]
