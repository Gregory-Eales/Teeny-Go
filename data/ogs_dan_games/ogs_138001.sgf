C[marcusa: are you not winning after b6 and d9?
Neandertaler: No, because you capture with d9 five stones at the top in sente (black has to capture at a7). Thereafter you capture additional five stones at the bottom, because black has no ko threats. That alone are 20 Ponits and white gets 6 points komi. I see no way, how black can get 27 points - i count 17 points for black.
marcusa: i see.
