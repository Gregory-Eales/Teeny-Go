C[wurfmaul3: Ah again
VanityLaw: you had me man !
VanityLaw: Dangit!
wurfmaul3: Yes, white should have protected at g3
wurfmaul3: When black breaks in like this, that costs white many points
wurfmaul3: we can play again if you want. But maybe it's better if you find another beginner to play
wurfmaul3: so it's not as one-sided
VanityLaw: ah \]
VanityLaw: can u teach me>
VanityLaw: ?*
wurfmaul3: maybe
wurfmaul3: what do you imagine?
VanityLaw: what do you mean?
wurfmaul3: I mean, I would call this game teaching, since I gave comments
wurfmaul3: when you say "teaching", do you mean more of this, or soemthing else?
wurfmaul3: (I mean, "teach", not "teaching", sorry)
VanityLaw: well the game in general and how to react to certain situations
VanityLaw: cause im confused even to what i pick XD
wurfmaul3: I will review this game, I hope that helps
