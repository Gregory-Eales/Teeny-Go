C[mark5000: Thanks
mark5000: Maybe there is another threat besides D2.
mark5000: Black could lose, I think. From move 39: D6 B4 E6 
nrx: I see, didn't think about that at all!
nrx: Nice, thanks for the suggestion.
mark5000: That means black made a mistake. I'll have to go back and find it.
mark5000: Thanks for playing.
