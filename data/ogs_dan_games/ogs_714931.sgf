C[mark5000: Have a good game.
mark5000: Hope the devs can get this komi issue sorted...
Mr Newby: Just play and the loser can resign based on 6.5. I shouldn't be here because the komi was wrong.

C[Mr Newby: HI Mark, I hope you don't mind me going slow on this game.  I want to give the #1 spot back to pollemand before I start losing games, as I shouldn't have won the game anyway
mark5000: Oh, okay. I'll just pause the game for now.
Mr Newby: cool.  Thanks
