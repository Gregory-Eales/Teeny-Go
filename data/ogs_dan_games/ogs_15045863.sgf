NEWOLDGUY: so here we go comment when you like 
wurfmaul3: ok

C[NEWOLDGUY: yes 
NEWOLDGUY: end of the start game 
NEWOLDGUY: this is exactly where i go way off base most games 
NEWOLDGUY: what should be my thinking right now 
wurfmaul3: actually you have already lost the game here
NEWOLDGUY: really??
wurfmaul3: yes
NEWOLDGUY: ok tell how ?
NEWOLDGUY: you are only 16 ahead
wurfmaul3: You have some territory in the upper left, the rest of the board is mine
wurfmaul3: in the upper right*
wurfmaul3: 16 is quite a lot
NEWOLDGUY: so i should spread out more then at beginning 
wurfmaul3: it's not easy to pin down to one rule
NEWOLDGUY: i thought i was taking control of cebtre
NEWOLDGUY: centre
wurfmaul3: take control of the centre? how?
wurfmaul3: e5 is your stone, but you can't get any points in the center
NEWOLDGUY: ok then i will go back to simulator and run this again till i get you down to say 7/8 ahaead here 
NEWOLDGUY: thanks for the instruct
wurfmaul3: you're welcome, but, wait please
wurfmaul3: what simulator?
NEWOLDGUY: ok
NEWOLDGUY: i running a prctice similator on a another pc get my moves  down
wurfmaul3: hmm
NEWOLDGUY: i will run this setup till i get it right 
NEWOLDGUY: hopefully
