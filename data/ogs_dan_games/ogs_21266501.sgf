C[mark5000: Oh, no. I play 19x19 at my Go club. But I only entered the 9x9 ladder here and haven't started many other games.
dsatkas: what do you think of the katago AI, is it trustworthy on 9x9?

C[mark5000: I think so. It's the strongest 9x9 AI I know of. But it has its own preferences, and lower rated moves can sometimes be just as good.
dsatkas: i'm asking because there are differences in the evaluation of 19x19 between kata and leela
