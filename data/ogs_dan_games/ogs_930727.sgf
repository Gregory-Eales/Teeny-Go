C[ST000MA: so close...
mark5000: You surprised it with move 10
mark5000: Big loss of confidence there
ST000MA: for me or him? was it bad?
mark5000: For it. You were winning it said.
ST000MA: aw...
ST000MA: so what was my mistake?
mark5000: It didn't see E9 either. It thought it was winning by 6.5
mark5000: I would say G6 should be at G5.
mark5000: Black can't kill you, and it's more forceful.
ST000MA: hmm, i agree.
mark5000: G5 was too solid for black.
ST000MA: how about one more game?
ST000MA: i think i can beat lvl4!
mark5000: Yeah. One more before lunch.
ST000MA: ok.
mark5000: I think you can too. You're better than 9k on 9x9
