C[mark5000: White will probably want to try for just one big group in this game.
heavenlyalchemy: Right, that's what I was thinking. If black had played move 5 at G4, would white have tried for two groups by taking the upper right?

(;B[ff]
C[mark5000: If black G4, both ideas are playable. White G3 or G6 or G7.

C[mark5000: Very close
mark5000: This way of playing would KILL most DDK players
heavenlyalchemy: DDK?
mark5000: double digit kyu.
heavenlyalchemy: Ah, okay
heavenlyalchemy: yeah, I have really been thinking over the stuff you ran by me last time, and it has helped my games quite a bit
mark5000: You play like a low kyu player who miscounted or something.
heavenlyalchemy: =) Well thank you
heavenlyalchemy: Let me think...
heavenlyalchemy: at turn 21
mark5000: There were no mistakes, just a point here and there, it seems.
heavenlyalchemy: I knew I was behind by a couple
mark5000: yeah, I can help identify that point
heavenlyalchemy: Would you have played any different, knowing that I had to turn it into a fight?
mark5000: No, I welcome that anytime. haha
mark5000: I played just like normal.
heavenlyalchemy: Lol, well that's what 9x9 is all about! So if you played as black, after turn 21 when you can tell you are losing by 2-3 points, would you have played anything differently than I did? Or was it too late at that point to fight?
mark5000: 21 is too late. you played perfectly after that
mark5000: your invasion could trap many players like this. From move 18: G3 H3 G2 H2 J4 J3 J6 J4 H1 
heavenlyalchemy: Wow, that is really interesting actually
heavenlyalchemy: I'll give that play some thought
heavenlyalchemy: And that is a good reduction, even if white doesnt fall for the trap, right?
mark5000: of course white will not play 26
mark5000: But if it goes like that black wins
mark5000: even tenuki is not enough in that variation
heavenlyalchemy: Remind me what Tenuki is?
mark5000: It's a Japanese name. means "play elsewhere."
mark5000: We use Japanese terms in the West because Japanese professionals brought Go to the US and began to teach us. China and Korea also have their own terms.
heavenlyalchemy: Ah, okay. I remember reading it in a book, I had just forgotten it's meaning. Thanks
mark5000: I think it's a half point for black, actually
mark5000: variation 19. I don't think white can come back
heavenlyalchemy: If white plays 26 somewhere like F2 you mean?
heavenlyalchemy: So black captures, reduces territory by 1, and fills?
mark5000: Well that's a terrible move
mark5000: black wins by half a point. From move 18: G3 H3 G2 H2 J4 J6 J7 J3 H6 D5 D6 A5 A6 A4 J4 J5 J6 F2 J4 G1 J5 
heavenlyalchemy: Oooo
heavenlyalchemy: I see
mark5000: It's easy in 9x9 to finish a variation to the end like this.
mark5000: You can see exactly the result
mark5000: Maybe there is a better way, but it's really hard
heavenlyalchemy: Yeah. That is really interesting. Okay.
heavenlyalchemy: Would you mind if I send you a 19x29 challenge? or 13x13, if you prefer? I feel like I am slipping a bit in real games, by playing 9x9 so much
heavenlyalchemy: And I would love your insight on full board strategy
heavenlyalchemy: 19x19 I mean
heavenlyalchemy: =P
mark5000: this move saves white by one point. From move 18: G3 H3 G2 H2 J4 J6 J7 J3 H6 D5 D6 A4 
mark5000: It gives white a very small ko threat for the last point. haha
mark5000: Full board? you mean 19x19?
heavenlyalchemy: Yeah, a 19x19. And do you mind finishing that variation for me?The way I read it out doesn't benefit white
heavenlyalchemy: Oh, wait.
heavenlyalchemy: That's because I was looking at the old variation.
heavenlyalchemy: Nevermind, it makes perfect sense. 
mark5000: ko fight for the half point. crazy. From move 18: G3 H3 G2 H2 J4 J6 J7 J3 H6 D5 D6 A4 J4 J5 J6 F2 J4 A5 A6 J5 
mark5000: For 19x19, I'm certain you've heard the basics to get to 25k.
mark5000: Occupy the corners first.
mark5000: Then attack and defend the corners.
mark5000: Players can play a couple josekis and proceed to occupy the open areas of the board.
mark5000: You want to avoid direct fighting in the opening
heavenlyalchemy: I know the basics, yeah. I mostly have a hard time making solid judgement calls as far as what moves are worth the most points in the midgame. I tend to have a hard time presuming point value accurately.
mark5000: okay, the middle game is different from the opening. You're right.
mark5000: Usually there is one or more groups that are fighting for their life. The better fighter often wins the game.
mark5000: Playing games (mindfully) and doing go puzzles are the best ways to improve your fighting.
heavenlyalchemy: Do you have any resources for puzzles that you recommend? 
mark5000: You can look at pro games for recreation to get a feeling for good shape and direction of play.
heavenlyalchemy: Hm, watching pro games is a good idea, thank you
mark5000: There is a good assortment free online.
mark5000: http://goproblems.com/prob/logical_search.php
mark5000: You can limit problem difficulty to your level or above.
mark5000: I did about 3000 in a few months of lunch breaks last year.
mark5000: Really helped my game
heavenlyalchemy: Wow! That is a very cool website, thanks!
heavenlyalchemy: I can see how that would help a lot
mark5000: Go is an important hobby, but maybe I play too much.
mark5000: any other questions?
heavenlyalchemy: I think that's it for now; Thanks very much!
heavenlyalchemy: I'll see you around!
mark5000: great. bye
