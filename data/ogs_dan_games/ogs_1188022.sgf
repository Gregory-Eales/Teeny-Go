C[mark5000: have fun fighting!
Forensicator: Lately I feel like I've somehow regressed in my reading and my ability to read out narrow fights. I've missed a lot, so I'm hoping the 9x9 lets us focus on fighting fundamentals.
Forensicator: I'd like to play out without commentary and then do review :)

C[Forensicator: okay, I'll stop wasting your time. Is the issue that I'm too passive? Too aggressive? Just not good at predicting the next decent move?
mark5000: Move 3 looked greedy, I think
mark5000: Usually, it's white who has to live in two places
Forensicator: Hmmm
mark5000: But black gets cut right away
Forensicator: my strategy has usually consisted of using that first stone as an advantage in a fight
Forensicator: Now that I think of it, that does remind me of a 23k who threw random stones out in a local fight, getting himself cut way up
mark5000: Kind of, yeah
Forensicator: Problem is, I have recently started to appreciate the value of strong groups
Forensicator: but i'm losing more games, because it's made me play too passive.
mark5000: It's a small board, but the principles are the same: stay connected
