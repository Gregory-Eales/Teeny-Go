C[mark5000: Ok, this is the first move I'll call a mistake
mark5000: In Go, it's a basic principle to keep your stones connected together
Yonben: Well I was thinking as you defended yourself I should try to expand my territory
mark5000: when they are connected (or practically connected), they form a "group."
Yonben: Ok
mark5000: Groups make you territory
Yonben: So I should have played D6 for example ?
mark5000: The problem here is you left a gap in your formation
mark5000: Yes. It's almost the only move
mark5000: d6 is the spot
Yonben: Thanks

C[Yonben: f5 better ?

(;B[fe]
C[mark5000: No, g5 was strong
Yonben: Ow ok
mark5000: Ok, here I could call another error
mark5000: In Go, we try for "efficiency" of stones
mark5000: each stone should be doing some useful work.
Yonben: As in "territory per stone" ?
Yonben: Ow ok
mark5000: Kind of
mark5000: some purpose
mark5000: This move it seems clustered too closely to your other stones
mark5000: It's not terrible though
mark5000: It does help slightly, just not efficient
Yonben: And if you try to cut me from f5 you would have only one libertyso yeah, not much purpose I see
mark5000: You could play it anytime too
mark5000: I can never play there myself because it is suicidal
Yonben: Right

C[Yonben: Ok for the last few moves I tried being aggressive and made ou defend but now I'm really lost XD
mark5000: Yeah, it was a bit much
mark5000: you played like...rabid animal aggressive!
Yonben: Hahaha
mark5000: We can end here or play to the end. you choose
Yonben: So at this point, where could I secure territory ?
mark5000: Upper left and center areas.
Yonben: I feel there might be points to take bottom right
Yonben: haha
Yonben: I was wrong so
mark5000: It's not weak enough
