C[Crowside: I played correspondence heavily in chess also. The format made it easier to keep in touch with the game and still allow me to play from the office. ;)
Crowside: So what should I do? Should I just document my thoughts on here as the game goes on?
Crowside: Or do we save that until the end?
Crowside: Because right now I'm thinking if you play e5 I'm already losing as my d5 stone will be in atari and I won't be able to save it, yielding a ton of space advantage to you. 
Crowside: But I didn't see that until after I played d8

C[Crowside: And all of that is void because I didn't realize it was my turn. Oh god, I need coffee.
ponticello: no prob.  Ican't reveiw totally while in play or I wil lend up polaying myself
Crowside: No worries. 
ponticello: w e5 would have captured one stone though, yes
Crowside: Today's the day you lose to a 25k
ponticello: XD

C[Crowside: I think d8 is dead.

C[ponticello: it sure is
ponticello: atari facing the edge like that is always dead
Crowside: I'm at that point now where I'm not sure what to do

C[Crowside: Here's a concept I'm still wrapping my head around: for me to technically score points, I have to either enclose my loop, or branch off to the edge, right?
Crowside: I don't know if I should shore up defenses or reach out and grab b1 to make a touch point. 
ponticello: groups with a cramped base will need two eyes to aviod capture as well
