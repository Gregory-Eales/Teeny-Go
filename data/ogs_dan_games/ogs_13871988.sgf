C[Alxco: i may be wrong in my reading but i think the atari should have been at C6. This way i need to either capture the two stones or the 3 in the bottom to live. And each option result in a sure win by like 10 points for you no ?
Kosh.: I think you are right.  I have a theory that, "The main difference between SDK and Dan is consistency."  Certainly true in my case.

C[Alxco: I agree with your theory.
Alxco: I also found that Dans have a better vision of the distribution in territory, so that they play less greedy and overplay
Alxco: Anyway, you have good fighting skills and positional judgement, you were clearly better than me in this game
Kosh.: Thankyou but no.  You have won this game through stronger consistency.  I may have created an opportunity but I also let it slip away.  Thankyou for an excellent and instructive game.
