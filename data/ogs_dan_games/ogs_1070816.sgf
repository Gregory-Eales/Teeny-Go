C[mark5000: By coincidence, I just studied this game...
mark5000: I've been compiling a database of 9x9 games.
mark5000: You played all of fuego's moves, so I knew it.
MVGO: so you already had this exact game?
mark5000: It's incredibly strange. Most games break away from a known line around move 5/6. This one went the whole game.

C[MVGO: oh i know that game
MVGO: wow i really didn't notice it
MVGO: alright then, wow
mark5000: you murdered me in the first game. what bot are you using? is it fuego?
MVGO: what
MVGO: i played in a go tournament in sf yesterday
MVGO: No bot 
MVGO: and i unofficially played 9x9 there
MVGO: really

C[mark5000: well that's hard to swallow after this game.
MVGO: j7 is the only logical move to play

C[MVGO: In the top left i was hoping you would mess up
MVGO: and that was the most logical way
MVGO: the bottom right would not be necessary if i got the left

C[MVGO: I'm thinking hard about these moves and you insult me
MVGO: Okay, I'm thinking of playing e3
MVGO: what did he play?
mark5000: well it's not the game anymore
mark5000: your move waswaaay better than the desperate bot move. haha
MVGO: wait what
MVGO: What else could i have played
MVGO: really
MVGO: those 2 moves were set in stone
mark5000: at move 37, fuego panicked and played c7
mark5000: it's a kind of desperate bot move, which is always fun to watch.
mark5000: but don't worry too much. if you're not a bot, then you're one of the best 9x9 players on this site. it wouldn't be my intention to take away from that
MVGO: Looking back at it i wasn't that much better really

MVGO: which bout was it
MVGO: bot*
mark5000: it was fuego bot, on 110 cores. that's pretty amazing.
MVGO: 110 cores? that's pretty darn amazing

C[MVGO: yeah alright
MVGO: This game went on too long
MVGO: Thanks for the game
mark5000: Thanks
MVGO: who won their game? 
mark5000: The pro player. fuego missed the seki, it seems.
MVGO: fuego is the bot? 
mark5000: yeah. 110 cores of bot
MVGO: the seki wasn't nearly enough
mark5000: well get those bot tendencies checked out, mister. haha
MVGO: how does someone get 100 cores? 
mark5000: I don't know. hire a supercomputer?
MVGO: really that's crazy
MVGO: hard to imagine
MVGO: you can think had about something, and end up doing the exact same thing as someone else
mark5000: well I got a game review request, so I'll ttyl. bye!
MVGO: eventually, all 9x9 games would be recorded. that's crazy
mark5000: That's my intention.
MVGO: see ya
mark5000: bye
