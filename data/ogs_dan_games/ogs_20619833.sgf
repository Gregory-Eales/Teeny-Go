C[mark5000: Thanks
S_Alexander: I tried.
S_Alexander: Thanks for the game.
mark5000: The first cut was bad
mark5000: I think this is even. From move 9: D5 G6 D7 D3 C3 E2 C2 
S_Alexander: I guess so.
S_Alexander: Black 2 looks too soft?
mark5000: could try hanging. From move 9: D5 G7 G4 
S_Alexander: I'll think about that.
mark5000: I don't think B can ignore a fix. From move 9: D5 D3 G6 
mark5000: It looks hard otherwise. Maybe you can find a better way.
S_Alexander: Sure. I'll try next week again.
mark5000: Nice job making #4, BTW!
mark5000: See you the next time.
S_Alexander: Thanks again. Bye!
mark5000: Bye!
