C[Dorus: i'm still playing the same variation, but cortex changed
Dorus: It tries harder but actually made it easier i think
Dorus: possibly i made less mistake :P
Dorus: B4 B7 A7 terrible moves
Dorus: i'm closer to 5k and 19x19, not sure about 9x9
Dorus: Will try again in a few days for sure :)
Dorus: yeah, takes about a day to update the net right?
Dorus: yeah sunday sounds about right then, posibly saterday but friday will still be too easy
Dorus: It's moving up fast thou
Dorus: if it stops making 1-2 stupid moves i would have it a lot harder
Dorus: ty, gnight :)
Alderi: tsk tsk
Alderi: you don't get to tell me it feels stronger x)
Alderi: Heh
Alderi: Not yet ready to take on a 4k anyway
Alderi: Yup
Alderi: we'll see next sunday
Alderi: Wait for sunday at least, it won't be worth it to try before that I think
Alderi: I update it everyday yup
Alderi: I'm at around 13~15k games per day
Alderi: games are starting to go out the window too so it might get stronger now
Alderi: Anyway, have a good evening ^^
