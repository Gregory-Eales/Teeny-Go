C[chenyi: huh I think I calculated it wrong, I thought I can win this fight but didn't take G9 into account
mark5000: I think J8 worked for black too.
chenyi: yeah as long as you can do G9 I'm short by 1 liberty
chenyi: J8, I'll do J6 then you still have G9
chenyi: Actually J8 won't work
chenyi: if you do J8 I'l take G9
mark5000: J8, w G9, b D9.
chenyi: and it's a ko?
mark5000: yes, but black has more ko threats
chenyi: yes
chenyi: Can you talk me though early mistakes I made
chenyi: looks I didn't have much chance from the beginning
mark5000: H5 was too early
mark5000: forcing first. From move 5: D3 E4 H5 
chenyi: right I'll have a much bigger corner if I take D3
chenyi: thanks for the game and all the tips
mark5000: the other direction was also more promising, I think. From move 7: 
mark5000: After those 2 moves (9x9 moves fast!), it became hard for white
chenyi: right, you're weaker on the other direction
chenyi: so I might have better chance
chenyi: thanks again and see you in the other game! :)
mark5000: I think so. your moves after were great
mark5000: thanks for the game
