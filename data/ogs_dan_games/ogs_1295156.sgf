C[archpaladin1: so I'm starting in the center to take the most influence at the start
mark5000: That is the most common move. It's good.

C[mark5000: Descending might be a mistake. The one stone isn't worth very much, and I would look at d4 or d6 instead.

C[archpaladin1: I see it gives you opportunity to advance in the upper portion of the board, but doesn't it also provide a number of cutting points in the lower half?

C[mark5000: Which I am going to fix fight away
mark5000: right*
mark5000: I was thinking about this kind of variation. From move 14: D4 C3 C4 B4 D5 F7 B5 
archpaladin1: which I might have done prior to your last move - too late now though
archpaladin1: let me try and secure my territory more up top

C[mark5000: 9x9 is different from other boards because it is small. It's visualize a result easily to see if it's good enough.
mark5000: It's possible to visualize*
archpaladin1: my main problem is that I have difficulty balancing attack & defense
mark5000: After this move, white has 55% of the board?. From move 16: 
archpaladin1: I am falling back to secure my territory, not pushing out to invade yours
mark5000: That's how to decide when to fight harder
archpaladin1: and to invade I usually end up making weak shapes

C[mark5000: Right. That's pretty common

(;W[cd]
C[archpaladin1: where is a good attack at this point?
mark5000: maybe c3.
mark5000: c8 is possible, but I'm not certain it works
mark5000: Actually, c3 doesn't work either, I guess
archpaladin1: doesn't seem much room to push out here. From move 24: C8 D8 B7 
archpaladin1: this has more promise, I think. From move 24: C3 B3 B2 
mark5000: d1. From move 24: C3 C1 E1 B3 
archpaladin1: let's try c8 then

C[archpaladin1: ...I guess I should have waited a minute before hitting submit move!
mark5000: Your promise variation is what I thought at first, too
mark5000: You can undo

C[mark5000: It's hard to find a good invasion this far in the game.
archpaladin1: yeah - one poor move in 9x9 and it's all over
mark5000: An invasion will usually happen in around move 5-12
