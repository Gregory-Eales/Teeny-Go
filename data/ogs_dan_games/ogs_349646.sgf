C[Neandertaler: b invades for two reasons: a) he has to give komi
b) this exploits the weakness of d4. Standard is, that b gets some territory and w gets outside influence (that is the "feature" of the 4-4). This is ok for b - see my comment for move 6.

C[Neandertaler: I think this direction is inferior. If the standard sequence takes place b will live in the corner and w will get a wall. But that wall has no great power nor can it make (much) territory, because b is not easy to attack on the right side. I'd prefer c4.

C[Naizen: I really wanted to try and prevent eye space to go for the kill, but i guess c5 was the better choice here? just try to restrict you points in the corner/side?

C[Neandertaler: On the 19 x 19 board w can go for a kill with this move, but only, if he is strong on the outside. In other words: B5 drives black in the center so w should have a position to stop the escape route. This is also true on the 9x9 board. - But here w doesn't have such a position. Worse: b has stones on the other side of the board, ready to help a possible break out. So, yes, c5 would have been better.
