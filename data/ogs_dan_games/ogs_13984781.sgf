C[wurfmaul3: hmm you've played this kind of move in all three games
wurfmaul3: it's actually usually a bad move
WongGuoRong: not good to do one space jumps and then a knight move?
wurfmaul3: it's the white stones next to it that matter
WongGuoRong: i never connect cause i feel you not yet attack me
WongGuoRong: you mean the last move isnt good?
WongGuoRong: cause only leave me with two lib
wurfmaul3: Well in a four stone handicap game you can play almost anything, but yeah, it's not a very good move
WongGuoRong: ok i will try another move
wurfmaul3: hmm ok

C[WongGuoRong: like this better? strength the C3 and attack your E3 too

C[wurfmaul3: If we're playing real Go, you're fine
]
(;W[fh]
C[wurfmaul3: but g3 will probably die
wurfmaul3: I recommend...
wurfmaul3: this move. From move 5: F4 
wurfmaul3: Next you can play at A or B
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
WongGuoRong: i never thought of protecting G3
WongGuoRong: even when 3 of your pieces were attacking it
]
(;B[cd]
C[wurfmaul3: If we're playing normal Go, it's completely fine that g3 dies

C[WongGuoRong: on a 9x9 i cant allow that?
wurfmaul3: your territory should be larger than mine

C[wurfmaul3: If we're playing "first capture wins the game" you can't allow it :) but we didn't say we are

C[wurfmaul3: I thought "first capture wins the game" might be easier to learn from
]
(;W[hd]
C[wurfmaul3: because then it's much easier to understand why you lost the game if you do lose
WongGuoRong: i mostly try to surround and form my territory 1st in striaght lines
WongGuoRong: and i seldom opt to capture opponent unless he self atari

C[wurfmaul3: Interesting that you play here
WongGuoRong: bad move?
wurfmaul3: good move
WongGuoRong: i thought its not that bad
wurfmaul3: it's good, but maybe you don't know why it's good :)

C[wurfmaul3: hahaha
WongGuoRong: why you remove the stones
WongGuoRong: thats what the people do
wurfmaul3: I was kidding
wurfmaul3: I was referring to that
WongGuoRong: they modify the score
wurfmaul3: I did it only because you told me about people doing it
WongGuoRong: lolz
WongGuoRong: actually still can play right
wurfmaul3: No, not really
WongGuoRong: do you want to play it out for me to practise
wurfmaul3: ok
WongGuoRong: i know but just for training for me

C[WongGuoRong: the 5 stones i played inside your area killed the eyes right?
wurfmaul3: no
WongGuoRong: E1 / F1 and G3 and H3 and J5
WongGuoRong: oh i played in these positions to prevent eyes
wurfmaul3: I don't really have eyes at the moment, but I can easily make them
wurfmaul3: if I play at g1 for example, then e1 and f1 will be one eye
WongGuoRong: if after i play J1?
wurfmaul3: I can play j4 for example
wurfmaul3: to make a second eye at j5
WongGuoRong: ohhh ok
WongGuoRong: then i wasted these 5 moves lolz
wurfmaul3: You lost no points because I answered them
wurfmaul3: You gave me prisoners but I reduced my own territory
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
WongGuoRong: you replied 5 times too?
wurfmaul3: But, in fact, I didn't really have to answer every one of them
wurfmaul3: actually I played four times inside my own territory
wurfmaul3: g3 was already there from the beginning of the game
WongGuoRong: oh ya
WongGuoRong: one of the placed handicap stones
wurfmaul3: yep
WongGuoRong: whats the diff if we play on a 13 x 13 board
wurfmaul3: hmm no fundamental difference?
WongGuoRong: how to know if I am really to play on a 13x13 board
WongGuoRong: what do i have to master on a 9x9 board 1st before i go up
wurfmaul3: hmmm
WongGuoRong: cos i read that beginners should play on a 9x9 1st 
WongGuoRong: so i just follow it but it did not explain why
wurfmaul3: on a 19x19 board a lot more things happen, so it's more difficult to track why you lose
WongGuoRong: to go into battle much faster and learn how to capture and life and death?
wurfmaul3: You can just try to play on a larger board, I don't think it's detrimental
WongGuoRong: ok, using same concept of style?
WongGuoRong: want to try a 13x13 board? I never played it before
wurfmaul3: another day, yes
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
WongGuoRong: add me as a friend please
wurfmaul3: seems I had already added you
WongGuoRong: I sent you a request
WongGuoRong: hmm funny did not appear on my friend list
wurfmaul3: Yeah you're not in mine either
wurfmaul3: maybe it's necessary to refresh
wurfmaul3: Oh wait, there you are
wurfmaul3: but you are displayed as offline, interesting
WongGuoRong: haha you are right
wurfmaul3: now you're online, fine
WongGuoRong: after refresh i see you online
WongGuoRong: you are going off?
wurfmaul3: by the way there is a 25k in chat
WongGuoRong: oh ok
wurfmaul3: in the list of chatters at least
WongGuoRong: i will go and private message him to be friends
wurfmaul3: Do as you like
wurfmaul3: Also, I've got another 25k friend online, XuanYu
wurfmaul3: Honestly I don't remember him
