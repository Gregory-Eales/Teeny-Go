C[Deep Scholar: decision of this opening may be questionable as it is fairly easy to draw in some lines on 7 komi.
Deep Scholar: simple 1.5 win for black in 8 g3 instead. From move 7: G3 B4 B3 F4 E4 G7 G6 H6 H5 F6 H4 G5 B5 B6 A4 A6 J5 J6 H3 A5 B4

C[mark5000: Thanks.
mark5000: During the game, I had thought the opening was good for me, given the GoQuest win rate. http://ps.waltheri.net/9x9/752231
mark5000: Of course, I would defer to AI on this.
mark5000: And the proof of the pudding is in the tasting, so to speak. I can't say it's good when White proves too difficult to kill in either corner.
mark5000: c2 was my attempt at a shape point.
mark5000: You had too much space and lived in spite of it.
