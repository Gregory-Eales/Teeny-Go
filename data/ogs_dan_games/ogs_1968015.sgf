Weltall: yeah
Kaworu Nagisa: and if you could play there, i would play at J6

C[Kaworu Nagisa: so
Kaworu Nagisa: theres nowher white can play
Kaworu Nagisa: and nowhere black can play
Kaworu Nagisa: without filling in their own territory
Kaworu Nagisa: white would need space to make 2 "eyes"
Kaworu Nagisa: in order to invade
Kaworu Nagisa: an eye is a sport like J1, E1, J3, G2/1, etc
Kaworu Nagisa: note that G1 and G2 are actually only 1 eye
Kaworu Nagisa: black could play either G1 or G2 and force white to capture
]
(;W[gi]
C[Kaworu Nagisa: So just to demonstrate
Kaworu Nagisa: white has 4 eyes
Kaworu Nagisa: you need at least 2 to be unconditionally alive
Kaworu Nagisa: meaning you need space if you were to invade your opponent to make the 2 eyes
Kaworu Nagisa: then its up to the opponent to try and take away the 2 eyes
Weltall: alright
Kaworu Nagisa: when all is said and done, and no one has anywhere to play, we both pass
