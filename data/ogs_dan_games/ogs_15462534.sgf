C[DualHelix: Dang
wurfmaul3: let me try to review quickly
DualHelix: I'm very willing to learn.  Just learned the rules today but been hearing about the game for a while.  Never was a big fan of chess but I do enjoy Go
wurfmaul3: here (or your g8) would have been better than  j7. From move 9: H8 
wurfmaul3: oh, just today, nice
wurfmaul3: when you play j7 I can easily separate it from your other stones
wurfmaul3: ok, so, g3 wasn't dead for most of the game
DualHelix: I guess I was thinking I wanted to capture that lone stone.  Is it better just to create bigger groups?
wurfmaul3: which stone?
wurfmaul3: I can't see what you can see
DualHelix: H7, that's why I played the J7, I guess I was trying to surround it
DualHelix: From the variation you posted
wurfmaul3: oh I see
wurfmaul3: if you want to capture it, you have to play h6
wurfmaul3: Otherwise I could just play h6 to connect it to g5
DualHelix: But you would have played h7 yourself to keep me from capturing right?
wurfmaul3: If you play here, I can't perevent you from capturing h7. From move 9: H6 
wurfmaul3: example variation. From move 9: H6 G6 H8 J7 J6 J8 J9 
DualHelix: But if you play h8 from there, doesn't it open more liberties I would have to shut down?
wurfmaul3: like this?. From move 9: H6 H8 G6 
DualHelix: Yeah
wurfmaul3: Yes, this would create more liberties for white, but white is surrounded (and won't get two eyes), so white would be captured eventually
wurfmaul3: another example variation. From move 9: H6 H8 G6 J6 H5 G8 F8 J5 H4 J4 J3 J7 G9 H9 F9 F6 J8 J9 J8 
DualHelix: Can you get to the corner and create eyes possibly with h9 and j8?
wurfmaul3: white gets one eye in the corner, but not two
DualHelix: Ah
wurfmaul3: j7 is not a real eye here. From move 9: H6 H8 G6 J6 H5 G8 F8 J8 G9 H9 F9 E4 J5 
wurfmaul3: because j6 is in atari
wurfmaul3: white needs h6 to make it a real eye
wurfmaul3: later in the game, you lost the lower left corner, because you didn't protect at b2
wurfmaul3: protect. From move 21: B2 
DualHelix: So if I played j7 it would kill the group?
DualHelix: I thought since I would be surrounded that my tile would be captured
wurfmaul3: it's not suicide when you capture something
wurfmaul3: you capture j6, so it's ok
DualHelix: Ohhhhh okay
wurfmaul3: when it's suicide and when it's not confuses many beginnerse
wurfmaul3: -
wurfmaul3: -e
DualHelix: Yeah, I didn't know I had that at all
wurfmaul3: you could capture two white stones here. From move 37: E5 
wurfmaul3: I think this review has gone longer than it should already, though
wurfmaul3: no good when the review is longer than the game, is it
DualHelix: Haha, I appreciate all the information though man
DualHelix: I plan to stick with it, I'm planning on getting a real board too so I'm trying to get the hang of everything so I can teach friends the rules
DualHelix: Would you like to play again?
wurfmaul3: hm hm good luck with that
wurfmaul3: yes we can play again
rinfifth: losing left corner was probably before the turn around
rinfifth: dead later?
