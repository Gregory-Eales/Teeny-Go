C[TheBlackPearl: gg, do you have any general tips for a new player?
]
(;W[]
C[Alxco: yes
Alxco: i would not use a contact play on the second move as white
Alxco: it strenghten the opponent making it hard to attack
Alxco: 1. From move 9: F3 
Alxco: overall you did pretty good for a 23kyu, the first mistake was probably at move 10
Alxco: variation 1 is better as it leaves no aji in white shape and attack black at the same time
TheBlackPearl: Was there any way to save that group of three after move 17, or was it pretty much done?
TheBlackPearl: The F3:F5 group
Alxco: after move 17 it was complicated because the shape is not good.  You can save it by playing F2 at move 16 but after the left group is in trouble...
Alxco: 2. From move 13: F2 E2 D2 F1 G1 E1 G2 
Alxco: the variation 2 is probably better than actual game to give a chance to save both groups
Alxco: shape is important, you want to avoid cutting points and keima when in trouble
TheBlackPearl: Alright, that makes sense.  Thanks for your help!
Alxco: you're welcome. Also, at move 32, connecting at A8 was the move ;)
