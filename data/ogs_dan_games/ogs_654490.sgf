C[mark5000: thanks for the game.
mark5000: anything you want to go over?
csaba: I think G1 was a mistake, right?
csaba: H1 would have been better
csaba: I had no ko threats at all
mark5000: Yeah, a little better.
mark5000: It's still not enough, though.
csaba: right
csaba: but I lost a point :)
csaba: not sure, where/when did I lose this one
mark5000: Let's see
csaba: okay
mark5000: something like this, maybe.. From move 8: B5 B4 F7 
csaba: hmm
csaba: this F7 looks weird at first
mark5000: E8 let me spill into your area.
csaba: right
csaba: interesting
csaba: I felt I had to answer E7 locally
csaba: your response makes perfect sense though
csaba: I meant B5
mark5000: I think your left group is fine. F7 right away seems good even without the reinforcement.
csaba: I see
csaba: thanks for the lesson
mark5000: Like this. From move 8: F7 E6 E8 
mark5000: You're welcome.
csaba: I hope we will be playing again some time soon ;)
mark5000: It's certain! bye
csaba: Thanks, bye
