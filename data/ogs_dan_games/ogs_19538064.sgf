C[Firebelcher: It seems there should be a library for all standard openings in 9x9 since there aren’t so many. Do you know if or have you made such a resource?
mark5000: Yes, definitely. My profile has one that I made a few years ago, and I'm creating a better one with a fellow 9x9 lover. Look for a release of that one real soon.
