stuff_rulez: probably not
Kaworu Nagisa: well
Kaworu Nagisa: first lets identify where i look weak
Kaworu Nagisa: where are some gaps in my defence?
Kaworu Nagisa: (i have 2)
Kaworu Nagisa: You saw how i poked into you via your gaps
Kaworu Nagisa: Where are the gaps in my wall?
Kaworu Nagisa: What about E1 and E9?
stuff_rulez: i was being told to do stuff

C[Kaworu Nagisa: How many liberties does my stone have.
Kaworu Nagisa: Can you threaten to capture it?
stuff_rulez: to my knowledge
Kaworu Nagisa: By making it only have 1 liberty?
stuff_rulez: no
Kaworu Nagisa: Well, if it has 1 liberty, it has to run right
Kaworu Nagisa: So, you can atari it
Kaworu Nagisa: a D8 or C9
Kaworu Nagisa: but pick carefuly

C[Kaworu Nagisa: interesting, no?
stuff_rulez: yes
Kaworu Nagisa: a good way to start palying, is to leave no weaknesses in your territory
Kaworu Nagisa: and to use yor opponents weaknesses to profit
Kaworu Nagisa: eventually you'll learn how to defend efficiently
Kaworu Nagisa: and what you can and cant attack
Kaworu Nagisa: you saw hwo the B5 attack doesnt work
Kaworu Nagisa: but how E1 and A3 did
Kaworu Nagisa: the way you learn how to play, is by exploring and learning what does and doesnt work

C[Kaworu Nagisa: then you can start to apply that on the bigger boards

C[Kaworu Nagisa: ok, so
Kaworu Nagisa: ill give you one more lesson in this game

C[Kaworu Nagisa: F6 is in atari right?
Kaworu Nagisa: should you save it?
stuff_rulez: yes
Kaworu Nagisa: ok, save it
stuff_rulez: save it ?
stuff_rulez: like
Kaworu Nagisa: like, G6 saves it right
]
(;B[gd]
C[Kaworu Nagisa: G6 saves, G6 takes.
Kaworu Nagisa: by saving 1 stone, you lost more. you have to always make sure that

(;W[gb]
C[Kaworu Nagisa: soemthing bigger isnt under attack
Kaworu Nagisa: so
Kaworu Nagisa: it would have been better to give up the 1 stone
Kaworu Nagisa: to save 3
]
(;B[hb]
(;W[ga]
C[Kaworu Nagisa: thats avery fundamental aspect of Go
Kaworu Nagisa: you cant try to save every stone
Kaworu Nagisa: you often have to give up a ffew here and there, to profit more somewhere else.

C[Kaworu Nagisa: see how H2 is automatically dead
stuff_rulez: yes
Kaworu Nagisa: also, note that C6, C6 and D7 arent territory for me
