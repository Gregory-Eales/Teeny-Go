C[ST000MA: yeah you were ahead... so have 1 point to waste ;)
ST000MA: thanks!
mark5000: This game was pretty close
ST000MA: yeah...
mark5000: I felt you were even a little bigger in the beginning
ST000MA: i was, but i gave you C1 and J7
ST000MA: i didnt know how to avoid that double sante...
mark5000: I like your move 3.
ST000MA: Thanks!
mark5000: It's not in my explorer, but I want to see if CS likes it now.
mark5000: I had to make that ugly elephant jump to get big enough to fight again
ST000MA: thats strange, it looks very good..
ST000MA: i am safe down right, get a lot of points, and you have D5
ST000MA: Was this played in some pro game?. From move 4: 
ST000MA: hmm, it wasnt...
mark5000: Nope
mark5000: That means nothing though. I think it's smart
ST000MA: what about this first? I was thinking of it, but C2 looked to weak.... From move 14: D5 
mark5000: can black win?. From move 6: F7 
ST000MA: i think black wins there...
ST000MA: but...
mark5000: Well your move 15 was better in the real game, I think
ST000MA: it was? o.O
ST000MA: i am curious about using elephant...
mark5000: fighting. From move 16: H8 E4 D3 F4 
mark5000: I think that was black's only chance. You couldn't catch up the normal way
mark5000: It looks bad, but it's a chance, I think.
ST000MA: this is 3rd time you use it against me, and it looks very good (i usually rush to cut elephand eye, but i never have courage to do it against you xD)
mark5000: Haha. I was so worried!
ST000MA: why?
mark5000: you get this, for example. From move 10: D5 D6 C6 
ST000MA: yes...
ST000MA: if you did it as black i would cut it as long as you are not too solid.
ST000MA: but as white...
mark5000: I understand
mark5000: Thanks for the games
mark5000: Bye!
