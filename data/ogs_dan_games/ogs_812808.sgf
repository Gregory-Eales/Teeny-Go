C[ST000MA: hello! enjoy the game!
ST000MA: do you have time for teaching games?
ST000MA: I am looking for someone to help me improve at 9x9...
mark5000: I'll do what I can, but you have 480 people below you on the ladder, so I feel you're doing perfectly okay. haha
mark5000: Have a good game.
ST000MA: last time i played with you we played many live games and you won absolutely all, most of them i resigned... there are 7 people better then me on this ladder, thousands in reality, and most of all, it was really interesting playing with you last time! ^^ So if it is ok, i will send you 5 challanges now (all unranked, title tournament style)
