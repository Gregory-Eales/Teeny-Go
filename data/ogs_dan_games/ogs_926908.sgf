C[mark5000: lol. I was curious about this opening. 4/4 losses for black, but the bot says it's perfectly okay.

(;B[dd]
C[mark5000: It looks risky.
ST000MA: how do you mean D6 will make you lose?

(;W[cc]
C[ST000MA: if a 5d bot says some move its ok, i dont think i can find a better one :P

(;B[fc]
C[mark5000: Maybe. It makes a lot of mistakes, actually.
mark5000: In particular, it undervalues 2nd line moves by a lot.

C[ST000MA: most of bots does... but i have seen a lot of pro players actually use it!
ST000MA: very often
mark5000: Yeah

C[ST000MA: ok, i think the game is over now...
ST000MA: where did you download Crazy Stone?

(;W[hc]
C[mark5000: It's not over. I'm not certain I'm even ahead.
mark5000: I feel it's kind of even, actually
mark5000: As for CS, it's not free. It's distributed by Unbalance corp.

C[ST000MA: what does CS say now: who is in better position?
ST000MA: are all of these bots moves? i dont really have a chance in this ladder, everyone uses a bot xD
ST000MA: and i have fuego... -.-
ST000MA: i can beat fuego, so it is not useful
ST000MA: and i use it only for small analysis in Alan Turing...
mark5000: Well, no. It's me playing. E7 was informed by my research w the bot, obviously.

C[mark5000: CS says black is winning.

C[ST000MA: Ill try to prove he is wrong! :3
mark5000: But I think that's b/c H3 was a brave move.
mark5000: I was worried about D9
mark5000: I thought it was even b/c I wasn't alive yet.
ST000MA: but i had to play something else before D9
