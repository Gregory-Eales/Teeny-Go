C[Ghrom: I don't see your plan, that scares me.
mark5000: Well, I miscounted badly and thought G5/H4 was enough to win. This is kind of my only shot now.
mark5000: Move 10 at B6 would have made a neat and tidy game in hindsight.

C[Ghrom: You didn't answer, can we review after the game? I wonder if I could win after your 32
mark5000: I'm not certain, but I think you could force a win after my 12, maybe all the way to my 36.
mark5000: We can review it, yeah
