C[lvrihanna: gg ty
lvrihanna: you have improved a lot
Lux Arcadia: lol noo
Lux Arcadia: You crushed me 
lvrihanna: last time I won so easily
lvrihanna: this time not so easy
Lux Arcadia: thanks 
lvrihanna: but still you might need to focus on which part is alive
lvrihanna: on a 9x9 board if you lose one troop
Lux Arcadia: yes i could see you kill my groups easily 
lvrihanna: usually you are dead meat
lvrihanna: not like 19x19
lvrihanna: 19x19 very big
lvrihanna: you can afford to sacrifice some groups
Lux Arcadia: yeah i wouldnt have space to make a comeback 
lvrihanna: 9x9 you normally can't
Lux Arcadia: ye
lvrihanna: and as white you have komi, so usually if you stay alive on 2 parts you can win
lvrihanna: or you get one large enough area
Lux Arcadia: yeah
lvrihanna: and as black you need to start some fights
Lux Arcadia: I just need to defend well
lvrihanna: black must play aggressively
lvrihanna: white should defend in response to that
lvrihanna: normally 9x9 games are like this
Lux Arcadia: Yeah its funn
lvrihanna: but 19x19 is more complicated
lvrihanna: and more tactics, more fun
lvrihanna: black still needs to pace up, but can play slow
lvrihanna: can afford to wait
lvrihanna: that's the difference between 9x9 and 19x19
Lux Arcadia: But 19x19 are so long and a pain 
lvrihanna: not so long actually
Lux Arcadia: You usually do only 19x19s and are great at 9x9
lvrihanna: when I started the KEmily account, that was my first account actually
lvrihanna: my first account ever online
lvrihanna: I finished 20 blitz games in 3 hours
lvrihanna: 20 blitz games on 19x19 board
Lux Arcadia: hmm yeah
lvrihanna: and 20-0 that night
lvrihanna: so if you want it to be fast it can
Lux Arcadia: thanks 
lvrihanna: it's totally up to yourself :P
lvrihanna: well gg ty
Lux Arcadia: i think im just scared of playing 19x19 
Lux Arcadia: and make up excuses 
lvrihanna: you might try it sometime
lvrihanna: get yourself a rank
lvrihanna: and play those guys
lvrihanna: it should be more fun
Lux Arcadia: hehe 
Lux Arcadia: yeah will do
Lux Arcadia: Thanks for the games :D
lvrihanna: after all you won't have to worry about not finding any opponents
lvrihanna: like I do right now...
Lux Arcadia: yeah i can find them easily 
lvrihanna: so have fun :P gotta go to bed now
lvrihanna: cya~
Lux Arcadia: Night night o/
