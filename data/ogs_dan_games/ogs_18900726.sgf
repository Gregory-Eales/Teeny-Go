C[mark5000: I had a bad opening this game. I thought the c3 stone would give more aji than it actually gave.
mark5000: That and f9 cramped my style.
mark5000: Now I'm lacking a good move to pressure the left white group. Oi.

C[mark5000: Congrats on your program. I had a chance to win against old Valkyria, Zen, CrazyStone. Here I felt powerless.
mark5000: Professionals have played c3 before. I thoughts DS would rip me apart if I continued with b5 immediately, so I treated c3 lightly instead. Probably I'll remove it from consideration in future games.
mark5000: I had expected Wg3 in response to Bc3, since the pros played there in the two games I'd seen before.
