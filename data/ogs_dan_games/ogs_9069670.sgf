C[p616901748: can we talk about the Counting?
p616901748: You said, it could be  a diffrence of +1
p616901748: Point with the Chinese Counting
Komencanto: Yes, but please show me, why you make B3
Komencanto: B4 suficxas, laux mi
Komencanto: enogh
Komencanto: enough?
Komencanto: I forgot tha word :D
p616901748: It is a wrong move
Komencanto: ah!
p616901748: You are right, B4 is already more than enough
p616901748: B3 is a gift of one point to you
Komencanto: Yes
p616901748: so we have +-0 without the Komi: a remis
Komencanto: Yes
p616901748: so
p616901748: I found a math. theorem:http://senseis.xmp.net/?LogicalProofOfTheEquivalenceOfTerritoryAndAreaScoring
p616901748: and it is crystal clear to me
p616901748: but why is it sometimes +1 difference?
p616901748: is it the chinese Rule to give the oppontent one stone, if you pass??
Komencanto: In Chinese rules a neutral territory cannot exist
p616901748: I don't understand if it is correct
p616901748: so you have to fill the dame points?
p616901748: okay we can play 13x13 in ca. 15 minutes when I am back again
p616901748: you can chat here
p616901748: my tab is open
Komencanto: They must to fill all the neutral points
Komencanto: In Chinese one
Komencanto: So the result dependes of the number of the neutral points
Komencanto:  odd щк тще
Komencanto: odd or not
Komencanto: Whose move will be last
