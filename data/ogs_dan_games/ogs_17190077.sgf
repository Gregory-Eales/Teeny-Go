C[ReadyToGo!: gg
martin3141: thank you for playing, good game
martin3141: 1. From move 16: E2 A5 A6 A4 B6 C1 G8 
ReadyToGo!: looks pretty hard for black 
ReadyToGo!: do you think that would have been a better choice?
martin3141: i think so, but I'm not sure
martin3141: maybe this. From move 32: H5 
ReadyToGo!: oh interesting choice, that makes a lot of sense
ReadyToGo!: gives extra points for sure
martin3141: if white has to connect, then yeah
ReadyToGo!: oh hm
martin3141: looks fine for black. From move 32: H5 H6 G5 H8 
martin3141: black gets lots of compensation for those stones, I think
ReadyToGo!: hm
martin3141: for example. From move 32: H5 H6 G5 H8 H9 J6 E9 J7 J5 H8 H2 
ReadyToGo!: that looks very convincing
martin3141: oh
martin3141: never mind
martin3141: there's a liberty problem with that move
martin3141: hm. From move 32: H5 H6 G5 H8 H9 J6 E9 J7 J5 H8 J3 
martin3141: yeah, I don't know ^^
ReadyToGo!: monkey jump should work, surley, shouldn't it?. From move 32: H5 H6 G5 H8 H9 J6 E9 J7 J5 H8 J2 
martin3141: right
ReadyToGo!: I think it's still a win, because black doesn't have the problem in the top right
ReadyToGo!: *top left
martin3141: this could be a problem. From move 32: H5 H6 G5 H8 H9 J6 E9 J7 J5 H8 J2 H2 J3 E6 D6 F6 F5 D7 
ReadyToGo!: oh yea
martin3141: anyway, thanks for playing! :-)
ReadyToGo!: J3 looks extremely slow but probably good enough
ReadyToGo!: or no
martin3141: there could be the same problem, with j3 also
ReadyToGo!: yea true
ReadyToGo!: it doesn't help at all with F6 problem
martin3141: anyway, I need to go
martin3141: have a nice day!
ReadyToGo!: thank your for your insights
ReadyToGo!: bye
