TheRatchetCookie: k thanks
TheRatchetCookie: i thought this was a lesson though
mark5000: Feel free to ask any questions anytime
TheRatchetCookie: like a teaching game?
mark5000: This is a teaching game.
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
TheRatchetCookie: I found this opening online that I want to try out
mark5000: That's a good first move. You're surrounding the corner area

C[mark5000: This is a teaching game.
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
TheRatchetCookie: I found this opening online that I want to try out
mark5000: That's a good first move. You're surrounding the corner area

(;W[fd]
C[TheRatchetCookie: Oh thanks
]
(;B[gh]
C[mark5000: That move is surrounding less area, so it's not as good
TheRatchetCookie: Oh
mark5000: It's surrounding h1 and j1
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
mark5000: You first move was surrounding four points
TheRatchetCookie: But I was going to play h4 next

C[mark5000: Oh, this opening...did you look at orthodox opening or something?
TheRatchetCookie: I don't know

(;W[eg]
C[TheRatchetCookie: Im just a beginner lol

(;B[fg]
C[mark5000: Okay. You can't do it on this small board
TheRatchetCookie: Oh ok
]
(;W[hd]
C[TheRatchetCookie: I have to extend to the left right?
mark5000: You can see how much territory I have surrounded on top
TheRatchetCookie: Yeah
TheRatchetCookie: Is that what you want to do>
TheRatchetCookie: ?
mark5000: Yes
TheRatchetCookie: Oh ok
mark5000: I only play moves I like
TheRatchetCookie: So like make a line with gaps between>
TheRatchetCookie: >
TheRatchetCookie: ?*
mark5000: It's efficient
TheRatchetCookie: Ok

(;B[hc]
C[mark5000: If you crawl one line at a time, someone faster than you will take more space
]
(;W[dg]
C[TheRatchetCookie: Ok
mark5000: This move is to split you'r stone apart from the other group
TheRatchetCookie: The in-between you just did?
mark5000: Yes
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
TheRatchetCookie: so what is a good move for me now?
mark5000: Try to live with one of the two stones
]
(;B[cf]
C[mark5000: You know life and death. What it means, yeah?
TheRatchetCookie: Not really
]
(;W[de]
C[TheRatchetCookie: Like sacrifice one stone for another
TheRatchetCookie: ?
mark5000: not really. Let me explain
TheRatchetCookie: I mean like 1 and let the other die?
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
mark5000: Life means you surround enough space so that I can't play inside and steal it away
mark5000: a group is "dead" if I can fully surround it and capture.
TheRatchetCookie: Oh ok
mark5000: So the left black gorup has to
mark5000: find enough space to make life
mark5000: Try pushing against my stones to find the space
TheRatchetCookie: And make life is like the "eyes" right?
]
(;B[ch]
C[TheRatchetCookie: That wasn't a good move
mark5000: Yes. Two eyes are necessary for life. Or the space to make them, at least
TheRatchetCookie: Ok
mark5000: Click undo if you don't like it
TheRatchetCookie: Ok that was better
]
(;W[gc]
C[mark5000: I'll kill this stone up here
mark5000: You can't save it
mark5000: Try living with the two bottom groups

C[TheRatchetCookie: Then you will go in the middle
TheRatchetCookie: Yeah

(;B[ef]
(;W[hh]
(;B[fe]
C[mark5000: you're trying to kill me. Does it work?
TheRatchetCookie: Probably not
mark5000: Killing doesn't work if the enemy can escape
TheRatchetCookie: Because you go to to D4
]
(;W[df]
C[TheRatchetCookie: And block it
mark5000: here, ... exactly
mark5000: I can just connect
TheRatchetCookie: So what do I do now?
mark5000: So you have the bottom left area.
mark5000: Make it as big as possible
TheRatchetCookie: How?
TheRatchetCookie: There is no space around?
mark5000: But you can steal space from me too
TheRatchetCookie: How?
mark5000: a5 or d2, for example
TheRatchetCookie: In a way that is easy I mean
mark5000: even c5
TheRatchetCookie: Oh like that

TheRatchetCookie: Yeah
mark5000: The game is over when there are no more points
TheRatchetCookie: Count up the "stars"
TheRatchetCookie: What do you mean no more points?
