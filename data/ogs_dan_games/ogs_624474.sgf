C[dafunk: Should I make tigers mouth at C2?
dafunk: Or is that area safe for now?
Pempu: it's safe 
Pempu: we are at endgame now. 9x9 games evolve pretty fast
dafunk: But what about the middle/
dafunk: Do I push inward?
Pempu: usually there is no territory coming to eaither side in the middle. As one would need to protect the middle from all direction and that is pretty difficult
dafunk: Oh
dafunk: Should I play J7 or just pass?
Pempu: you shouldn't pass

C[dafunk: Is that it?
Pempu: I got lucky. I got F4 E5 and D6 territory in the middle. I shopuldn't have gotten any 
Pempu: left side is still open
dafunk: Yeah, that came together well.
dafunk: So I should fortify that bottom area
Pempu: no
Pempu: it's rock solid
Pempu: you can push into my territory
