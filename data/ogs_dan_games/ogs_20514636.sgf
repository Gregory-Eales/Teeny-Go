C[mark5000: So many forcing moves!
Firebelcher: I can’t tell who is forcing who

(;W[ec]
C[mark5000: It's you forcing me. I had no choice for f3, f4, and f5. But you actually had several choices for every move so far.
mark5000: move 2. From move 1: 
mark5000: move 4. From move 3: 
mark5000: move 6. From move 5: 
mark5000: move 8. From move 7: 
mark5000: move 10. From move 9: 
mark5000: To name a few

C[Firebelcher: I don’t see how 3 is forced. Or really 5. And especially 9

(;W[cg]
C[mark5000: Move 3 isn't forced. I chose it freely.
mark5000: If I don't block 9, you get to push and cut here. From move 8: D3 C3 E2 F5 G5 G6

(;B[eh]
C[mark5000: Move 5 is mostly from a lack of good alternatives.
mark5000: The marked spots aren't that good in my experience. Pros prefer A.. From move 4:

C[Firebelcher: I was worried about leaving that open but figured if I defended it I’d lose for sure. Wasn’t sure F7 or G7 but I think F was not enough of a push
mark5000: The unfortunate thing about 9x9 is that one mistake can take you out. 19x19 is more forgiving. You're correct that F7 wasn't enough. But I think G7 was worse--more of an overplay.
mark5000: I think White's mistake was E7. It should be defending the lower side cut, either directly at D3 or descending at E2.

C[Firebelcher: So E7 was already an overplay?

C[mark5000: I think so.
