C[mark5000: Thanks for the game
Vulnerability: thanks
Vulnerability: you still have time?
mark5000: okay
Vulnerability: why D7?
mark5000: Safety. I was ahead and lazy
Vulnerability: yeah, ok.
Vulnerability: one more question
Vulnerability: move 18: why you didnt attack something like E3 first?
Vulnerability: Case 1. From move 17: E3 C5 C4 B5 G3 B4 B3 B6 B7 
Vulnerability: hmm, case 2 is same as 1...
mark5000: looks good for black. From move 17: E3 C5 C4 B5 G3 F3 
Vulnerability: hmm ok
mark5000: I feared the push and staying connected is a key principle
Vulnerability: can i send you next challenge?
mark5000: yeah.
