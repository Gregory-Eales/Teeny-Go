C[mark5000: Thanks
xhu98: Thanks for the game.
xhu98: Well played. This was very close and it took a lot out of me
mark5000: Congrats on #1
xhu98: I guess the correspondence time setting allowed me to go over the intricacies in the fight.
xhu98: Thanks indeed. But you'll be back soon :)
mark5000: Yeah, try not to lose until I beat you again next week.
xhu98: Hopefully :P
xhu98: I'm not a 9x9 specialist, so not too sure
