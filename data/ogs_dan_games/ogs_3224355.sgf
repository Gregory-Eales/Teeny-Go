Kaworu Nagisa: not so sure about that
EonPiece: why?
Kaworu Nagisa: you have to read out more
Kaworu Nagisa: cant jsut stop there and assume it works
EonPiece: i think it would stop you getting out as well as stop you from forming eyes, and if that group died the game would b prolly over
EonPiece: wanna try it from there? we can fork it
