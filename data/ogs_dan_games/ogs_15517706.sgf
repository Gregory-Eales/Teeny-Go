C[S_Alexander: Thanks for the game.
wurfmaul3: Thanks for the game.
S_Alexander: Try this one first?. From move 21: J4 
wurfmaul3: I was just looking at it
S_Alexander: Probably lost already
wurfmaul3: I don't know
S_Alexander: Because you don't need to answer and anything on left side kills me
wurfmaul3: hmm
wurfmaul3: ok the one variation I just tried is far too good for black
S_Alexander: So I have to answer this somehow?. From move 7: 
S_Alexander: Or maybe more flexible. From move 5: C8 
wurfmaul3: I felt like I had already lost when you played c3
wurfmaul3: In the end of course it's complicated
wurfmaul3: I was afraid of this. From move 9: F6 H5 C6 
wurfmaul3: I don't remember my conclusion
S_Alexander: i was looking at 1
S_Alexander: Looks like I'm too passive.
wurfmaul3: I'm curious what the "Puzzles" opening books say
wurfmaul3: 5.5 komi is probably just unfair though
S_Alexander: It's hard to play white, but I noticed I lose to stronger players with both colors.
wurfmaul3: my d6 is not in this https://online-go.com/puzzle/181 book so I guess it's not good
S_Alexander: Unusual moves are tricky to deal with.
wurfmaul3: I thought your c3 was a great move to threaten to cut at c6
wurfmaul3: I'll ask Leela nonzero about the game
S_Alexander: me too
S_Alexander: Anyway, if you want to play again, I usually have open 9x9 challenge.
wurfmaul3: we will probably play again then
S_Alexander: Thanks for the game again, bye.
wurfmaul3: Thanks, bye
