C[dsatkas: You're online, hehe ok. Premove is to tell the server to respond if the opponent plays a particular move
lovecall: oh, plan conditional moves?
lovecall: I did not do anything with it.
lovecall: I prefer to do it manually.
dsatkas: Yeah, since you're replying instantly on a turn based server I thought that was the case
dsatkas: But you're just online :)
lovecall: yes
dsatkas: Oh well of to work
