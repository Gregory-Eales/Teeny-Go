C[mark5000: G6 was a bit conservative. E7 may have been better.
Firebelcher: I thought that was too small. Was thinking F7 though. You’re saying E7 and squeeze?

C[mark5000: See http://ps.waltheri.net/9x9/399146
mark5000: F7 isn't in the book, so to speak. But I agree with you that it may be stronger than G6. I don't know what you mean by squeeze.
