C[KEmily: mhmm mainland China is doing a very good job about the virus
KEmily: the situation is already under control
KEmily: and Chinese ppl pay enough attention to their own safety.
KEmily: At least when the government asked them to stay at home, they did.
KEmily: so I guess that's not an issue... hopefully.

C[KEmily: BTW I saw today some funny conversations in the chatroom... maybe it's your student.
Myous: We never trust China, its no way. because of China, you see the virus is everywhere in the world, and they now try to said that the virus is not come from Chine.... but everyone know the true... we are not stuiped... 
Myous: if they didnt hide the news of virus... if will not terrible
Myous: tis China's fault...
Myous: its*

C[KEmily: well... I'm not trying to be political here
KEmily: but HK is part of China
KEmily: and what China has done in Wuhan deserves 100 percent respect
KEmily: nowhere else in this world can a country build a hospital in 6 days, and another one in 8 days, that can hold 1,000 patients

C[Myous: well you are not from Hong Kong, even not a chinese(maybe you are), but Hong Kong is not China. you would never know what does China did to Hong Kong
Myous: they conceal facts of China Virus, hide the numbers, concealing everything to the news, and keep spread virus to the world. 
Myous: Respect? China? really? the world need to respect China and thanks to them? i not think so.
Myous: they try to shirk the responsibility to other Country... USA, JAPAN, Korea, general not in China. AMAZING.
Myous: "They know where it came from. We all know where it came from.

C[KEmily: well...
KEmily: I am Chinese
KEmily: and I'm in Hubei province
KEmily: the center of the virus
KEmily: I happen to have been to Wuhan just a few days before the lock-in started
KEmily: and I've lived in Wuhan for 3 years before 2016
KEmily: This is a city that deserves respect
KEmily: Maybe if you can stay in mainland China for a while
KEmily: you'll have a completely different idea towards the whole country
Myous: they why i guess you are from China. becuse in this moment can still "100% respect" for China... its only 中國人.
KEmily: you'll see what the goverment is doing, what every citizen is doing, when all this happens
KEmily: Yep. And such respect comes from my own experience. I see what happened in the last 2 months.
