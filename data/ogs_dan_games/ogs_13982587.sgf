C[WongGuoRong: oh 2 eyes already?
wurfmaul3: oh, hmm, j7 isn't a real eye
WongGuoRong: i thought i killed one eye
WongGuoRong: why J7 isnt a real eye?
wurfmaul3: I've got only one real eye at j4 and j5
WongGuoRong: its all surrounded by your white stones
wurfmaul3: Let's say you play e9 now
WongGuoRong: if it was me, i would have thought its two eyes
WongGuoRong: and i rem i got killed when i formed such eyes on the side lolz
WongGuoRong: E9?
]
(;B[ea]
C[wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: Now you've got two eyes at f9 and g8
]
(;W[da]
C[wurfmaul3: play h9 next
]
(;B[ha]
C[wurfmaul3: I'll play a useless move
]
(;W[dd]
C[wurfmaul3: Now, if you play j9, it's an atari
wurfmaul3: So I lose j8 or I fill at j7
WongGuoRong: oh have to read so many steps ahead to know its a false eye
WongGuoRong: almost 5 or 6 moves
WongGuoRong: lolz i aren't at that level yet
]
(;B[ia]
C[wurfmaul3: You don't really have to read ahead to see what's a real eye and what's a false eye
]
(;W[ic]
C[wurfmaul3: With practice it's possible to recognize them at a glance
WongGuoRong: hmm then why cant i tell if its a false eye and you can if you did not read ahead?
wurfmaul3: It's not a real eye because j8 was not connected to the other stones
WongGuoRong: ok later i will go to review and try to picture it again
wurfmaul3: wait
WongGuoRong: ok
wurfmaul3: I repeat: it was not a real eye because j8 was not connected to the other stones, except through j7
wurfmaul3: if there was a white stone, it would have been connected to the other stones even when white doesn't connect at j7
wurfmaul3: sorry
wurfmaul3: If there was a white stone at h8
WongGuoRong: oh if H8 is a white stone then its 2 eyes?
wurfmaul3: Yes
wurfmaul3: To make it simple, it's a real eye if everything is solidly connected. Diagonal connections don't count
WongGuoRong: lolz no wonder i always get killed in games i always leave my parts like this thinking it is 2 eyes and they always get killed and i would curse saying why i have 2 eyes still die
WongGuoRong: sometimes the players dont kill me 1st and play elsewhere
WongGuoRong: and i thought they are safe lolz
wurfmaul3: It's a problem many double digit kyu players have
WongGuoRong: I see
wurfmaul3: It might be good to practice distinguishing real from false eyes, but I don't have a problem collection handy at the moment
WongGuoRong: hmm its ok, i learnt something today
WongGuoRong: will try to avoid this again when i play others
wurfmaul3: If you want, let's continue another time

C[WongGuoRong: correct?

(;B[ci]
C[wurfmaul3: But I like this better for you than when you played at c1 without b1
]
(;W[hi]
C[WongGuoRong: oh C1 better than B1
wurfmaul3: No, that's not what I meant
wurfmaul3: It's fine either way. I like the moves you played after the undo.
WongGuoRong: haha i am not sure if it is good but i rem the 2nd and 5th stone if you place, you can get two eyes in some life and death puzzle
WongGuoRong: so i undo and put 5th stone instead
WongGuoRong: this game still can continue
wurfmaul3: I don't really know what you mean with 5th stone
WongGuoRong: another points i not quite sure when the game should end or resign too
wurfmaul3: When you're not sure you should play on
WongGuoRong: hmm its a puzzle to destory the eyes
WongGuoRong: now seems like no more meaningful moves for me
WongGuoRong: i wont want to play inside my own enclosure on the left hand side right?
wurfmaul3: There actually isn't
WongGuoRong: but is there for you? I am not sure
wurfmaul3: No, there isn't for white eithier
wurfmaul3: My last few moves were all pointless, too
WongGuoRong: if i pass, you will pass or you will try to play inside?
WongGuoRong: I see
wurfmaul3: Hmm now that you say it, I will try to play inside
wurfmaul3: But only because it's not a normal game
WongGuoRong: why wont people play inside?
wurfmaul3: because it's usually useless
WongGuoRong: cos no chance for two eyes in this small area?
wurfmaul3: yes
WongGuoRong: how big an area before 2 eyes can be made?
wurfmaul3: That's a good question, and difficult to answer
wurfmaul3: You need either weaknesses in the opponent's walls, or some empty space along the edge of the board
wurfmaul3: The black walls have weaknesses at b7 and c5, but they are not so bad
WongGuoRong: why are they weaknesses?
wurfmaul3: And with empty space along the edge of the board I mean something like a3 a4 a5 a6 a7, but it's not enough
WongGuoRong: if you cut in, you only have 2 libs each at these 2 points
wurfmaul3: Hmm maybe I shouldn't call it weakness
wurfmaul3: b7 and c5 are cutting points, potential weaknesses, but there is no actual weakness here
wurfmaul3: because if I cut at b7 or c5 you can just capture

C[WongGuoRong: ok i remove my own lib by playing at A7 lolz, did not think of that
wurfmaul3: hmm
wurfmaul3: the three stones b6, c6, c7 have got one liberty
wurfmaul3: whether you play at a7 or not
wurfmaul3: it's the same shape as in the first game
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
WongGuoRong: so the A7 was not the mistake?
wurfmaul3: a7 is a mistake
wurfmaul3: it's a mistake because it doesn't fix the problem of the c6 stones having only one liberty
WongGuoRong: how about i play C4
WongGuoRong: to force you play A5?
wurfmaul3: In response to c4, I could capture at b7
wurfmaul3: it's similar to a7
WongGuoRong: hmm then how to escape?
wurfmaul3: there's only one move
wurfmaul3: it's not difficult
wurfmaul3: when you play a7, a5 or c4, I play at b7, don't you see a pattern? :)
WongGuoRong: B7?
wurfmaul3: yes
WongGuoRong: they will die too
wurfmaul3: no
]
(;B[bc]
C[wurfmaul3: seems I had to ask first
wurfmaul3: sorry, no
wurfmaul3: Maybe it wasn't that easy
WongGuoRong: but how come can esscape with no 2 eye
wurfmaul3: My stones don't have two eyes either, so it's ok if your stones don't have two eyes
wurfmaul3: What should white play now?
WongGuoRong: lolz hard for me only maybe as i dont have the talent to spot such things
WongGuoRong: A4?
wurfmaul3: It's understandable that you didn't want to play b7
wurfmaul3: In the first game playing a move like b7 didn't help
wurfmaul3: In this game it's different because you have stones at a8 and b8
]
(;W[af]
C[WongGuoRong: mistake?
wurfmaul3: Yes
wurfmaul3: ask for undo?
WongGuoRong: ok
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
wurfmaul3: This situation is confusing even for me
WongGuoRong: ok i dont know where to play anymore 
WongGuoRong: should be no more moves right?
wurfmaul3: how would you decide where to play? By trying to predict what your opponent would play etc
wurfmaul3: But it's difficult when you have difficulties to see ataris
wurfmaul3: You can pass
wurfmaul3: But I will play on
WongGuoRong: hmm its true, sometimes i make thank you moves lolz
]
(;B[]
(;W[ca]
C[wurfmaul3: Now you shouldn't pass
WongGuoRong: but any other places i put means death
wurfmaul3: why death?
wurfmaul3: I know a good place for black to say, but I won't tell you unless I have to
wurfmaul3: black to play*
WongGuoRong: ok A3 still need 2 moves
wurfmaul3: Yes, a3 is fine
wurfmaul3: a3 is an atari but white can just ignore it
wurfmaul3: capturing a4 doesn't help black's b7 stones
WongGuoRong: but its 1 point more for a captured stone right?
wurfmaul3: maybe
wurfmaul3: it's complicated because black has to worry about playing a1 and d1 like you saw
wurfmaul3: black has a way to kill all white stones
WongGuoRong: I see
wurfmaul3: killing all white stones is much better than capturing one stone
WongGuoRong: yup
wurfmaul3: Actually I think there are three good moves for black
WongGuoRong: so instead of A3, play A1 follow by D1?
wurfmaul3: hmmmm the problem with a3 is that white can play at a9 and capture six black stones
wurfmaul3: if black plays a1, white can still play at a9 and capture 6 stones
wurfmaul3: the question is: how to prevent white from capturing the 6 stones?
WongGuoRong: oh it can be prevented?
wurfmaul3: Yes
WongGuoRong: from here onwards?
wurfmaul3: Yes
wurfmaul3: In three different ways even
WongGuoRong: play J1?
wurfmaul3: playing j1 will not prevent white from playing a9 and capturing the six stones
WongGuoRong: you need two moves to capture the 6 stones right
WongGuoRong: A9 and A7
wurfmaul3: Yes
wurfmaul3: If you play J1, white plays A9. The six stones are not captured yet
wurfmaul3: But in the next move, white plays A7 and captures them.
WongGuoRong: then i can capture 2 of your stones in my next move
WongGuoRong: G1 and H1
WongGuoRong: ok how to prevent
WongGuoRong: not to capture lolz
wurfmaul3: Capturing g1 and h1 is good, but if black plays one of the correct moves, all white stones are dead anyway
wurfmaul3: that's as good as capturing 35 stones then
WongGuoRong: ok how about J4 so that one more J5 filling will capture your whole group on the top if you fill in A9
WongGuoRong: but you will fill J5 and kill it right?
wurfmaul3: j4 is a good idea
WongGuoRong: but it is invite for death isnt it
WongGuoRong: you will surely play J5 to kill it wont you
wurfmaul3: I can do that, but it's actually good for black
WongGuoRong: good? why good to give one piece to you?
]
(;B[if]
C[WongGuoRong: oh i thought captured
wurfmaul3: I've got liberties at j4 and j5
WongGuoRong: still have 2 more holes the other side
wurfmaul3: yes
WongGuoRong: lolz i miss things like this
wurfmaul3: How many liberties do your stones have in the upper left?
WongGuoRong: 1
wurfmaul3: How many liberties does the a3 chain have now?
wurfmaul3: it's not two
WongGuoRong: oh its 3 lolz i missed the J1 again
wurfmaul3: hehe :)
wurfmaul3: oh... actually I was wrong, a3 is not fine
]
(;W[ie]
C[WongGuoRong: oh have danger?
wurfmaul3: Your b7 stones only have one liberty now, and there's no way to save them
wurfmaul3: I'll play at a7 no matter what you do
WongGuoRong: hmm
WongGuoRong: no 2 eyes and surely dead
WongGuoRong: i still have moves?
wurfmaul3: hmm good question
wurfmaul3: I think yes
WongGuoRong: have moves but destory own libs?
wurfmaul3: it's complicated
WongGuoRong: J1, C4 and A1 putting in will be destorying own libs
WongGuoRong: F9 and G8 putting in will be destorying own 2 eyes
WongGuoRong: J5 and J4 will be thank you move for capture
wurfmaul3: playing a1 is not bad
WongGuoRong: whats the purpose for playing A1?
wurfmaul3: Well I say "good", but really, it's neutral
wurfmaul3: White gains one prisoner, but if black plays correctly, all white stones die
WongGuoRong: i still cannot prevent the 6 stones from being captured
wurfmaul3: white just added a stone at j5, that's going to be a prisoner for black
wurfmaul3: You can
WongGuoRong: ermm i dont see the next move lolz
WongGuoRong: A9 is death A7 too
wurfmaul3: Yeah, a9 and a7 are not good
WongGuoRong: A5 cant be played
wurfmaul3: right
WongGuoRong: A1 now?
wurfmaul3: Hm, well
wurfmaul3: a1 is not bad, but why do you do next?
WongGuoRong: D1
WongGuoRong: but still one move behind
WongGuoRong: cos 3 vs 2 libs
wurfmaul3: I don't really know what you mean
wurfmaul3: d1 would be a bad move
wurfmaul3: even after a1
wurfmaul3: with d1 you would put five stones into self-atari
WongGuoRong: oh yeah
WongGuoRong: lolz please guide the way
wurfmaul3: Ok
wurfmaul3: play c4
WongGuoRong: how to prevent the 6 stones to not be killed
]
(;B[cf]
C[wurfmaul3: so you can play at d1 next
wurfmaul3: without a1 it would have been a self-atari
wurfmaul3: Ah, yes, I said a3 was fine, but it wasn't
WongGuoRong: A3 will kill the whole group right?
wurfmaul3: No, you've got a second liberty at j1
WongGuoRong: oh ya
wurfmaul3: So that's why you never suggested a3 and c4
WongGuoRong: lolz keep missing the J1
wurfmaul3: yeah, that was the whole problem
WongGuoRong: i keep missing this little things
wurfmaul3: In chess I keep missing things like that too
WongGuoRong: one more stone to make a false eye become a real eye and one more missing empty space for lib
wurfmaul3: Anyway, so black has two liberties and is fine
WongGuoRong: you will play A 5 now?
wurfmaul3: Looks like I don't have a choice
wurfmaul3: I can't capture anything to save the two stones, so I can only connect there
]
(;W[ae]
C[WongGuoRong: filling all these gaps give me points?
]
(;B[ag]
C[wurfmaul3: You need these moves at a1 and d1 to kill the white stones at the bottom
wurfmaul3: If you never play them, it would become a seki
WongGuoRong: oh they can be killed
wurfmaul3: here, if black never plays d1, and white plays a5 and c4, it's a seki
wurfmaul3: Because then black has only two liberties and d1 or j1 would both be self-atari
wurfmaul3: do you want to see that?
WongGuoRong: ok lets play it out
WongGuoRong: A3 next move right for me?
wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: white has no good move
WongGuoRong: ok i see it now lolz
wurfmaul3: The a5 stones are in atari and white can't do anything
]
(;W[]
C[WongGuoRong: lolz if you dont tell me i will pass 
]
(;B[ac]
C[wurfmaul3: Ah. J1 actually lost a point
wurfmaul3: No wait
wurfmaul3: much more than one point
wurfmaul3: right
WongGuoRong: oh ok lolz
wurfmaul3: Now the game is finished for sure
WongGuoRong: I am terrible lolz
wurfmaul3: I missed that it was a self-atari too, at first
wurfmaul3: There's a lot I would want to go over in this long game
WongGuoRong: ok, i have the time to listen to your reviews
wurfmaul3: I would actually like to undo many times
WongGuoRong: ok
wurfmaul3: But first, let me say that in this diagram, black has won by many points
wurfmaul3: Now that these stones are captured, black's stones are all fine
WongGuoRong: hmmm i did not thought the 6 stones was possible to be saved
wurfmaul3: so white's stones are all dead
wurfmaul3: I told you they could be saved, you can trust me :)
WongGuoRong: ok if have 10 mins per move to slowly think and at your level maybe can get it
WongGuoRong: its 10 X 1 min round right usually
WongGuoRong: and after that have to play within 30 secs?
WongGuoRong: the japanese byo mi rule or something like that
wurfmaul3: I don't know, you can decide the time settings when you play
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
wurfmaul3: If you mean automatch settings, I don't know, I rarely use them
WongGuoRong: I see
WongGuoRong: are you a professional player?
wurfmaul3: hehe, no, just an amateur player
wurfmaul3: professional players would have ranks like \[9d\] or \[4p\]
WongGuoRong: there are dan levels for amateur levels too?
wurfmaul3: yes
WongGuoRong: oh theres 1d for professional players right
WongGuoRong: when they 1st become pro they are 1d right
wurfmaul3: when you see "1d" in a go server, it almost always means 1 dan amateur
WongGuoRong: thats what i watched from hikaru no go lolz
wurfmaul3: a new pro would be "1p"
WongGuoRong: oh I see
wurfmaul3: and 1p is *much* stronger than 1d
WongGuoRong: there are pro players in here?
wurfmaul3: Sometimes there is yoonyoung\[4p\]
wurfmaul3: she announces in the chat before she streams on twitch
WongGuoRong: oh i see
wurfmaul3: There is also Haylee\[4p\]
wurfmaul3: both are female professionals from korea
WongGuoRong: they are also real life professionals?
wurfmaul3: Yes, that's what professional means
WongGuoRong: should be as it mirrors the game if they play 19 x 19
wurfmaul3: hm hm not sure what you mean
WongGuoRong: i mean if they are professional players in the servers, they should be pro in real life too
]
(;W[]
C[WongGuoRong: .........
WongGuoRong: how to capture your lower stones
WongGuoRong: as if they play 19 x 19 games, its no different from real life except you dont pick up the stones and placed on the boards only
wurfmaul3: You get a professional rank on a go server when you contact the admins and prove them that you are a real life professional
wurfmaul3: there is no such thing as a "internet professional"
WongGuoRong: oh lolz
WongGuoRong: ok i did not know that
WongGuoRong: anyway i dont think i can ever reach even am 1dan
WongGuoRong: just learn and see if i can reach 20 kyu lolz
]
(;B[aa]
C[wurfmaul3: So, here, black should pass
wurfmaul3: And black has no points at the bottom
WongGuoRong: noted
wurfmaul3: When you see someone with a \[8d\] or \[9d\] rank, that means they may be of professional strength. It could be a professional who hasn't claimed their professional status
wurfmaul3: I mean hasn't contacted the admins

C[WongGuoRong: ah I see
wurfmaul3: I don't know if you wanted to see this
wurfmaul3: but this would be the correct way to score

C[wurfmaul3: It could also be a beginner using a bot

(;W[]
(;B[ai]
C[wurfmaul3: You know, these black moves actually lose one point of territory each
]
(;W[]
C[wurfmaul3: Because the white stones would be counted as dead anyway
WongGuoRong: oh ok
WongGuoRong: some players i ever encounter they go and click on the stones when counting and make me lose really one sided in the count
WongGuoRong: i asked them why they do that
WongGuoRong: they dont answer and keep making the score 1 sided during the count even if i win
WongGuoRong: then i just press accept to let them win lolz
wurfmaul3: hmm
wurfmaul3: sounds like people lacking empathy
WongGuoRong: some players better and maybe they thought they winning on count and then they return to the game and they defeat me with more moves inside my area
wurfmaul3: I know that some players will mark alive stones as dead just to annoy you
WongGuoRong: but why the computer allows people to modify the auto score?
wurfmaul3: without seeing the game I don't know
WongGuoRong: ya they mark my stones all dead
WongGuoRong: if they dont mark i will win on the score
wurfmaul3: "but why the computer allows people to modify the auto score?" good question, let me answer
WongGuoRong: but i dont care who wins cos i just want to learn lolz
wurfmaul3: games here are usually played with Japanese rules
WongGuoRong: but then i never review the games and i never learnt much too hahaha
wurfmaul3: With Japanese rules, you don't want to play inside your own territory, because it will reduce your points
wurfmaul3: Hmm...
wurfmaul3: There can be situations where it's extremely difficult to tell whether something is really territory or not
wurfmaul3: There is no efficient algorithm to determine it
WongGuoRong: hmm ok 
WongGuoRong: not surround it completely means its your territory?
wurfmaul3: So the computer can be wrong sometimes
wurfmaul3: Hmm...
wurfmaul3: In most cases, it's not that difficult
WongGuoRong: you mean other countries rule encourage you to play inside your own area?
wurfmaul3: It seems I don't understand the problem myself
wurfmaul3: With chinese rules, you don't lose points when you play inside your area when the game is already finished
WongGuoRong: hmm ok but must really know if the game is finished?
wurfmaul3: Chinese*
WongGuoRong: most people play Japanese rule?
wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: on go servers at least
WongGuoRong: haha ok, then i stick to japanese rule games
wurfmaul3: hmmm
WongGuoRong: so what do you think i can do to improve my game play from the 2 games you have played with me?
WongGuoRong: not much 25kyu players out there that can play with me
WongGuoRong: and when i create games, usually 18 kyu or below come in and crush me lolz
wurfmaul3: players at 25 kyu aren't that rare
WongGuoRong: but i seldom see them asking for a game
wurfmaul3: Yeah... you know, they register and are displayed as 13k at first
WongGuoRong: I have a friend 21kyu but even then i cannot win
WongGuoRong: oh not everybody starts at 25kyu?
wurfmaul3: You started as "13k"
WongGuoRong: oh i thought we all start at 25k lolz
WongGuoRong: must have lost too much
WongGuoRong: i think i lost more than 30 or 40 matches in total
WongGuoRong: just win a couple 
wurfmaul3: the "13k" rating is only provisional, the server has no idea how strong you are
wurfmaul3: so you don't need to lose so many games until you are 25k
WongGuoRong: haha but I did
WongGuoRong: I once even lost a 5 stone handicap to a 6k or 8k player lolz
wurfmaul3: Anyway, It's not rare to see 25k players in the chat
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
WongGuoRong: will look out for them
wurfmaul3: Diabolic used to be 25k but now he's 20k unfortunately
WongGuoRong: so i should find a 25k partner and play with him and review the games?
WongGuoRong: too good for me 20k
wurfmaul3: You can also try to find exercises for beginners
wurfmaul3: There are books for beginners with exercises
WongGuoRong: under the puzzles?
WongGuoRong: i tried some of them and some i could solve but when it comes to the real game i cant plan out the moves or see them
wurfmaul3: I mean real books
WongGuoRong: not sure why this is the case
wurfmaul3: There are exercises like "count the number of liberties"
WongGuoRong: there are puzzles for counting of liberties for beginners too
wurfmaul3: oh hm hm
wurfmaul3: I don't really know
WongGuoRong: i think i know how to count and understand what is a liberty but i need to concentrate and not miss a small part out of the whole board
WongGuoRong: miscount will make you think it will not work sometimes
wurfmaul3: hmm there was something I wanted to say
wurfmaul3: I forgot
WongGuoRong: hmm
WongGuoRong: about gameplay or? 
wurfmaul3: I don't know
wurfmaul3: doesn't matter
WongGuoRong: haha its ok
WongGuoRong: anyway you should be from US right?
wurfmaul3: no, I'm from Germany
WongGuoRong: oh ok
wurfmaul3: I guess you're from the US then? :)
WongGuoRong: nope i am from Singapore
wurfmaul3: Hehe
WongGuoRong: its 11+ over there for you now?
WongGuoRong: at night i mean
wurfmaul3: I think it's called 12:45 pm, 45 minutes after midnight
WongGuoRong: ah ok 
wurfmaul3: I woke extremely late so it's not very late for me
WongGuoRong: i am 7 hours ahead of you
WongGuoRong: its 7.45am here now
wurfmaul3: oh
wurfmaul3: have you slept?
WongGuoRong: nope
WongGuoRong: I arent working today so its alright
WongGuoRong: which city you from?
wurfmaul3: Actually I went to bed at maybe 10am today
WongGuoRong: lolz i see
wurfmaul3: and woke at maybe 5pm
WongGuoRong: you aren't working?
wurfmaul3: no, I'm a sudent
WongGuoRong: ah ok
WongGuoRong: how old are you?
wurfmaul3: 23
WongGuoRong: cool
wurfmaul3: student*
WongGuoRong: I am 35 this year
WongGuoRong: what are you studying?
wurfmaul3: math and computer science
WongGuoRong: ah, I studied IT back in my schooling days too
WongGuoRong: but i came out to work in the engineering field haha
wurfmaul3: aha
WongGuoRong: want one more game?
wurfmaul3: Ok, but I want to say one thing at least about this game
wurfmaul3: if you had connected here, there is no problem at all. From move 61: C5 
wurfmaul3: that's it
wurfmaul3: I should have said it earlier, but we kept continuing
WongGuoRong: move 62?
wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: It became difficult because you didn't connect
WongGuoRong: hmm ok
wurfmaul3: If you connect you've got many liberties, no problems
WongGuoRong: always aim to connect?
wurfmaul3: hmmm connecting is good in general
wurfmaul3: when I invade a tight space like b5, and you just connect all your stones, my stone dies automatically
WongGuoRong: but only connect when it is neccessary?
WongGuoRong: like theres a threat or something?
wurfmaul3: yes
wurfmaul3: if I don't play b5 you don't need to connect, because if I play c5 you play b5 and will capture c5
WongGuoRong: but frankly your B5 move did not reduce any of my existing stones lib
wurfmaul3: b5 threatened to cut at c5
wurfmaul3: without b5 cutting at c5 is not very dangerous
wurfmaul3: very easy for black. From move 60: C5 B5 
WongGuoRong: oh a one space jump from D5 is dangerous as it is a threat for cutting at C5?
wurfmaul3: yes
WongGuoRong: I see so apart from attach or a stone next to an opposition reducing the lib, a one space jump might be a threat too in this example
wurfmaul3: Yeah, kind of
WongGuoRong: ok noted
wurfmaul3: if black just connects though there is nothing for white
WongGuoRong: I see
WongGuoRong: If I connect at C5 with black stone still no two eyes right
wurfmaul3: Do you mean for white or for black?
WongGuoRong: oh i think two eyes for black at A4 and C4
wurfmaul3: black will get two eyes, it's not a problem
wurfmaul3: Black can capture the white stones at the bottom, that's easily two eyes
wurfmaul3: Black can play A3, A1, D1, F1. There is no rush.
wurfmaul3: White can't do anything to prevent it, the black group has enough liberties no matter what
WongGuoRong: caused the two white stones cant do anything?
wurfmaul3: two?
WongGuoRong: I see
WongGuoRong: i mean A7 and A6 white stones
wurfmaul3: sounds like we're not looking at the same position
wurfmaul3: example. From move 61: C5 B4 A3 B6 B7 A4 A1 A6 D1 C4 F1 
WongGuoRong: i understand what you mean
wurfmaul3: Next game then?
WongGuoRong: i can still kill it in this varation cause only one eye right
wurfmaul3: right
WongGuoRong: the A7 is false eye
wurfmaul3: Oh a7 is less than a false eye, a7 is not surrounded by white stones
wurfmaul3: it's just a liberty
WongGuoRong: haha ok not even an eye
