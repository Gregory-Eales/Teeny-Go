C[MaMiFreak: Thank you for the game!
MaMiFreak: it feels like my g4 was a mistake but i am not sure if g5 would have been better.
MaMiFreak: what do you think?. From move 26: G5 
xhu98: Feels like any move should be fine as long as they don't make H3 sente for White. From move 26: H5 
xhu98: Still complicated though. From move 26: H5 B3 B2 E2 
xhu98: But yeah, thanks for playing!
