C[Platitude: Ugh...
Platitude: Well, that was the most fun I've had in a while. :)
mark5000: I think these 9x9 games have been my favorite ones on the site
mark5000: thanks for the game
Platitude: You're welcome.
mark5000: enjoy your day
Platitude: There should be some way to adjust the komi, for small games or reverse handicaps.
Platitude: You too. :)
mark5000: yes. I hope it's coming with the site changes
Platitude: I'm having trouble accessing the beta.
mark5000: I'd like to see fractional komi, like the japanese
Platitude: Yeah, the more customizable, the better, but this is a pretty darn good site.
