C[karasock: e-3 i think.
mark5000: Oh, yeah
mark5000: I made that eye false, but e3 wasn't the move.
mark5000: It was false after d5
mark5000: That put it in atari, so it was not a true eye
karasock: okie i was wonder if it would be if my stone was white.
karasock: but that makes sense

C[mark5000: Correct. You can play both!
karasock: Thats pretty much it thou isnt it?
mark5000: There is f5.
