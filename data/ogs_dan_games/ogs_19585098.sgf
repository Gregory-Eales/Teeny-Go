C[ST000MA: gg ty
mark5000: gg
mark5000: F5 was surprising.
mark5000: probably this is better. From move 7: E6 F6 E5 F5 C2 
mark5000: Poking at the connection might be enough to win. I'm not sure.
ST000MA: my intuition was saying not to play F5
ST000MA: but it feels to good to divide diagonaly xD
ST000MA: too*
mark5000: lol
