C[Bolzano: ok, i have two advise if you want
Bolzano: advice or advise by the way ?
Kaamil: I'd love to hear that
Bolzano: iam not sure of the word so ...
Kaamil: Actually both exist
Kaamil: But in that case
Kaamil: Probably advise
Bolzano: ok :)
Bolzano: when you put a stone in contact with my stone
Bolzano: like that
Bolzano: 3. From move 3: 
Kaamil: Yeah?
Bolzano: this is usualy defensive move
Kaamil: Oh
Bolzano: because i am stronger after thees exchanges
Bolzano: 4. From move 6: 
Bolzano: and the corner is mine
Kaamil: Oh that makes sense
Bolzano: and this is the same. From move 13: 
Kaamil: What would be an offensive play?
Bolzano: so when you want attack you have to enclose enemy stone with one stape distance
Bolzano: in this position. From move 0: C3 C4 C5 C6 E3 
Bolzano: if you want to attack white stone
Bolzano: what is your move ?
Kaamil: Well I'm not sure
Kaamil: Should I stay connected?
Bolzano: no, not all the time
Kaamil: To the rest of the black stones
Kaamil: Hmm
Kaamil: What do you mean with one stape distance?
Bolzano: one space*
Bolzano: sorry mistake
Kaamil: Oh okay
Kaamil: Hello?
Kaamil: Oh yeah
Bolzano: yes
Bolzano: you find !
Kaamil: So maybe e5?
Kaamil: Or f4
Kaamil: Which is one space?
Bolzano: ok, so G3 is the point
Kaamil: So should I try to get the corner?
Bolzano: white is safe and he as the corner. From move 0: C3 C4 C5 C6 E3 G3 G3 G3 G3 G6 G6 G6 G6 G6 G6 E5 G3 
Kaamil: Oh yes you are right
Bolzano: same. From move 0: C3 C4 C5 C6 E3 G3 G3 G3 G3 G6 G6 G6 G6 G6 G6 F4 F3 F3 F4 F4 F3 G4 G3 G3 
Kaamil: Oh yes
Kaamil: That makes sense
Kaamil: You are good at thinking ahead
Bolzano: So the third line is call "territory line" and if you take thisline you will take point generaly
Bolzano: And my second advise is:
Kaamil: That's why people start the game at line 3 as well?
Bolzano: line 3 and four yes
Kaamil: Okay boted
Kaamil: Noted*
Bolzano: because withs theese line it more easy too make a solide group of stone and take point
Kaamil: Okay
Kaamil: Makes sense
Bolzano: after you will try to take the center witch is big but difficulte too make a solid group in it
Kaamil: Alright
Bolzano: And the second advise is "do you know the chinese proverb:
Kaamil: Chinese proverb?
Kaamil: No I don't?
Bolzano: "The corner is the gold, the  the edge are the silver and the center is the desert"
Kaamil: Ohhh
Kaamil: No I didn't knew this
Bolzano: (difficulte to find word in english for me)
Bolzano: x)
Kaamil: Don't worry
Bolzano: Ok look:
Bolzano: For 5 stones you have 4 points. From move 0: C1 C2 C3 B3 A3 
Bolzano: in the edge you need 8 stone for 4 points
Bolzano: 6. From move 0: A3 B3 C3 C4 C5 C6 C6 B6 A6 C6 
Kaamil: Oh yeah
Bolzano: and the center.... From move 0: D4 D5 D6 D7 E7 F7 F7 G7 F7 G6 G5 G4 F4 E4 
Kaamil: And in the center the most
Kaamil: Right
Kaamil: That makes sense
Bolzano: 7. From move 50: 
Bolzano: so look the game:
Kaamil: You had all the sides
Kaamil: And corners
Bolzano: Yes and all corner
Kaamil: And I tried to take the center
Kaamil: Which was my mistake
Bolzano: Yes, so i am ok with that and i make the echange
Bolzano: true
Kaamil: Wow yeah
Bolzano: This is why usualy firs moves are in the corner
Kaamil: Instead of attacking you at the beginning I should have taken another corner?
Bolzano: So remerber this is defending :
Bolzano: 8. From move 3: 
Bolzano: attaking is this one
Bolzano: 9. From move 2: E7 
Bolzano: or this one
Kaamil: Yeah right
Bolzano: 10. From move 2: G5 
Bolzano: but simply pay this is ok :
Kaamil: But in my head I wanted to attack you
Bolzano: 11. From move 2: C7 
Bolzano: yes sure !
Bolzano: or this. From move 2: C3 
Kaamil: Sounds great
Kaamil: Now I know it
Kaamil: Thank you!
Bolzano: And you when you discover go ?
