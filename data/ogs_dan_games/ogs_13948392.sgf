C[Vivian_Vex: Thank you for the game
wurfmaul3: Thank you
Vivian_Vex: I am apparently scary lol
wurfmaul3: Yes you are
Vivian_Vex: Wait really? How so?
wurfmaul3: You've got, like, bright yellow eyes
Vivian_Vex: oh my fucking picture. XD
Vivian_Vex: Gotcha
wurfmaul3: this would be habhatti's part, but "hmm"
wurfmaul3: I'm thinking about the game, I guess I just don't like the spacing between your first two moves...
Vivian_Vex: Neither do I
wurfmaul3: I think you should play here to live. From move 21: B4 
wurfmaul3: But at that point, maybe I was already leading
Vivian_Vex: I haven't played two star points in a row since I was like 18 Kyu
Vivian_Vex: well
Vivian_Vex: Two star points away since I was 18 Kyu
wurfmaul3: away?
Vivian_Vex: I didn't play on the star points but I played the same distance acrossthe board. Like I wuld normally maybe do something like
Vivian_Vex: G3 and D3
Vivian_Vex: Not on the C and G line though.
wurfmaul3: hmm... sounds like esoteric opening theory
wurfmaul3: Well I don't really have anything to say. Thank you again.
Vivian_Vex: Thank you as well.
habhatti: Hmm
