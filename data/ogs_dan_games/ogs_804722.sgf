C[MrGorkajuice: Thanks for the game. Can I ask for your opinion on what my first bad move was? My own feeling in hindsight is C3
MrGorkajuice: Err, C7 even, my second move
mark5000: Yeah, I think just extending was better for move 4
mark5000: d1. From move 3: D4 
mark5000: Once black got the move, white has to manage both groups, and it's a tricky position
mark5000: white can fight like this. From move 3: D4 C4 C5 D6 C3 B4 F5 G6 B5 B3 C7 
mark5000: also, C3 becomes a good move once white prevents D4. From move 3: D4 G4 C7 
mark5000: also possible. From move 3: D4 G4 C5 C6 E5 D6 E6 E7 F7 
mark5000: fighting pattern. From move 3: E5 E6 D6 
mark5000: another way. From move 3: C3 G4 C7 
mark5000: So I feel white 4 was wrong, as you said.
mark5000: Thanks for the game.
MrGorkajuice: Thanks for the input!
