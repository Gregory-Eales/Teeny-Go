C[Mr Newby: Thanks for game again Mark
mark5000: Thanks.
mark5000: I don't think it was good to finish the joseki
Mr Newby: No, clearly 
mark5000: Black is better, I think. From move 14: D7 H6 C7 
Mr Newby: Hmm... yeah, much better
mark5000: Actually, I liked black until then. I may have to rethink myself here.
Mr Newby: I was thinking black was in the best position as well until D7
Mr Newby: It seems that was a better point than g6
mark5000: Yeah. yeah yeah yeah. White's moves seemed natural, so maybe invading 3-3 was wrong.
Mr Newby: I thought so.  I'd never seen it this early in a 9x9
mark5000: d1. From move 3: G6 
mark5000: anyway, good game. always fun.
mark5000: bye
Mr Newby: Yeah, I wouldn't have been so cocky with that play
Mr Newby: cheers
