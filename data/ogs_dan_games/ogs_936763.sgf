C[ST000MA: thanks for the game!
mark5000: I think you could have fought the ko
ST000MA: how?
mark5000: B7 was a threat. Maybe
mark5000: b/c you can just push if white takes
ST000MA: i was thinking about that but it is too small i think...
mark5000: It's a trade, and it's hard to count who's leading then
mark5000: Yeah.
mark5000: See you!
ST000MA: he wins by 3.5...
ST000MA: see you!
