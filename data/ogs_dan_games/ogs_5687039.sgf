C[mark5000: gg
xhu98: Thanks for the game.
mark5000: maybe just this next time. From move 6: E3 
xhu98: Yeah, probably
xhu98: Doesn't look like bad for White though
xhu98: Top right corner is pretty solid
mark5000: Solid for both. Game about the endgame, I guess
mark5000: Thought I could do better but you lived.
xhu98: I thought
xhu98: What if you just let me live with small area?. From move 20: F2 G2 C7 
mark5000: Looks doable
xhu98: Ah, I could hang tough. From move 20: F2 G2 C7 C8 
mark5000: Yeah, that would be white
xhu98: How's this?. From move 16: H4 G5 H3 
xhu98: Alternative. From move 16: H4 H3 G5 F2 J2 
mark5000: this is nice for black. From move 16: H4 
mark5000: maybe I can hang tough with this. From move 12: H5 
xhu98: Yeah, I thought it would be hard for White to live actually
mark5000: Was banking on that. oh well :)
xhu98: I recommend that you check out this series
xhu98: They did a little lecture on miai invasions
xhu98: I thought that was helpful
mark5000: lol
mark5000: miai. From move 16: H4 B4 
xhu98: btw I'm like 70% through editing of Episode 8
xhu98: lolz
xhu98: tesuji desu ne :O
mark5000: lol
