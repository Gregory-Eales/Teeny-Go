C[xhu98: Oh crap, did I miss an undo request?
xhu98: >.>
thiosev: yep. My fault anyway. shouldn't play before finishing my first coffee.
thiosev: Thanks for the game
xhu98: Thanks for the game! Sorry about that
xhu98: Maybe the coffee was too good :)
thiosev: It was ok if I played g8 right?
xhu98: I think so
xhu98: It was my last jab actually
xhu98: Capturing the seven stones didn't give me the lead :)
xhu98: This is interesting though. From move 41: G8 H7 H8 G5 H6 G4 F3 H5 J7 H3 H2 J2 J4 
thiosev: Yes that would be tricky.
thiosev: I though I could save the 7 stones at some point.
thiosev: here.. From move 25: F5 
thiosev: but it was much harder to read than giving them up.
thiosev: I don't know how this would go.. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 E2 C2 G6 G5 F7 F5 
thiosev: I probably doesn't work for me.. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 E2 C2 G6 G5 F7 F5 H5 F3 F2 G3 H3 G2 H2 H6 G7 H4 
thiosev: does it work this way?. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 E2 C2 G6 G5 F7 F5 F3 
thiosev: Nope. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 E2 C2 G6 G5 F7 F5 F3 G7 H6 H5 H7 A5 
thiosev: lol.. too many variations this way.. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 G5 
thiosev: Oh. this looks like the best way to do it.. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 E2 C2 G5 
thiosev: Nope.. this doesn't work either.. From move 25: F5 F4 E3 F6 E2 C2 G5 G6 H6 H5 G4 H4 G3 H7 G7 J6 F7 H6
