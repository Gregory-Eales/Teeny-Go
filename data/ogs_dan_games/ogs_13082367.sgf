C[mark5000: Well, darn.
asifu: hm
mark5000: C8 looking like an overplay.
mark5000: Thanks
asifu: gg
asifu: thanks
mark5000: Thought I could get a little extra
asifu: thought you would
mark5000: Is this enough?. From move 33: A4 C8 
mark5000: I didn't think it was.
asifu: so you honna help me with apropiate raank?
asifu: boring..coming all the way from 25k when i know am around a 5d
mark5000: It's enough just to play ranked games. Mods don't change ranks since we introduced glicko
mark5000: If neither move works, then A8 was the first mistake.
asifu: move 34????\\
mark5000: maybe G7. From move 31: G7 
asifu: lol mark has moved me up once before when i was 25k and beat a 1d
asifu: a while ago
mark5000: It must have been before glicko was introduced.
asifu: i guess
asifu: whats that
asifu: i have said 1 million times am a 5d
mark5000: It's not sandbagging, which is understood as losing on purpose.
asifu: 20th time today am a 5d
asifu: nuke you going to take my 9 stone handicap offer?
asifu: i have never lost to anyone here but minusgo
asifu: yup
asifu: i faced the 8d
asifu: i dont know how it works but it takes a lot to beat it
mark5000: Maybe hopeful. From move 15: E2 C2 A2 
asifu: whats glicko
asifu: haaa
asifu: am familiar with elo from csgo matchmaking
asifu: ok well mark good game i had fun hopefully we can play again sometime
mark5000: Fo sho
mark5000: better?. From move 15: E2 C2 B6 C7 B7 B8 F4 F5 H4 G5 H2 
FrostedNuke: just play ranked games
wurfmaul3: I think white didn't have enough without c8
jmdingess: you start out 13k not 25k on this site tho :)
FrostedNuke: yes asifu was never 25k
FrostedNuke: on ogs
upstart: asifu are you sandbagging?
upstart: you are 6k yet you beat mark5000 6D
upstart: XD
FrostedNuke: well he is saying hes 5d repeatedly
FrostedNuke: so hes not sandbagging if he says that
upstart: 8. From move 15: C2 D2 E2 C1 E1 D1 A2 
upstart: maybe
upstart: in 9X9?
upstart: i beat minusgo before
upstart: 1 out of 20
upstart: 8d
FrostedNuke: like elo but different
upstart: 9. From move 15: E2 F6 
upstart: is this better for black?
upstart: accept that that 2 stone going to die
upstart: because squeeze can happen later
