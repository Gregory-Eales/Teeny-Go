C[minusGo: Thanks for the game, I hope you had fun!
p616901748: https://senseis.xmp.net/?Snapback
minusGo: Snap back and bent four
minusGo: Those are its weak points
minusGo: Thanks a lot for playing against it :)
p616901748: what software do you use?
minusGo: A server at work, with 2 gtx 1060
minusGo: but I limit it to 8000 playouts per turn, so it could run on almost anything I think
p616901748: ah it is your own work?
minusGo: Not really, I'm implementing the method from alpha go zero, and the program itself is a modified version of leela
p616901748: ah okay
p616901748: I am a bit disappointed:
minusGo: I'm the one running this experiment though
minusGo: Ah?
p616901748: I thought oh great a 3dan bot 
minusGo: It's progressing more and more
minusGo: I hope it learns the snap back and bent four soon
p616901748: so you use leela zero
minusGo: Yep
minusGo: A modified version for 9x9
p616901748: why don't you use the newest network weights?
minusGo: Because Leela Zero is for 19x19
p616901748: interesting
minusGo: I'm just using the programm, but I've trained this 9x9 one from scratch by myself
p616901748: is it trained with the players data
minusGo: Nope
minusGo: Only self-play games
p616901748: or only with playing against itself?
minusGo: As of now it has generated 240k games
p616901748: oh I am dreaming about a bot learning from the OGS players
p616901748: i will rematch, okay?
minusGo: I thought about that, maybe when a better method to learn more quickly has been invented ^^
p616901748: yes
minusGo: No problem, have fun ^^
