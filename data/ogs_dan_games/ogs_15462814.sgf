C[wurfmaul3: ahh
wurfmaul3: so, first, you can believe me, the stones in the lower right corner are really dead
wurfmaul3: Becauase I could play h2 to capture three stones
DualHelix: So remove those
DualHelix: Or wait
DualHelix: Am I supposed to remove or no.  Does it score them if I select them
wurfmaul3: when they are transparent with white dots on them they are counted as dead, as it should be
DualHelix: Oh alright
DualHelix: Sorry lol
wurfmaul3: no problem
DualHelix: Damn plol
DualHelix: Dang lol**
wurfmaul3: Ok, now, in the game, I actually didn't capture at h2
wurfmaul3: And if I had captured at h2, I would have lost by 0.5 points
wurfmaul3: I didn't cheat or anything, this is the normal way to finish the game
DualHelix: Oh I know haha
wurfmaul3: But you didn't have to capture at d2
wurfmaul3: If you hadn't done that, you would have won
DualHelix: Wait, why did it count against me?
wurfmaul3: d3 was counted as a prisoner either way
wurfmaul3: but d2 isn't counted as a point anymore when you play there
DualHelix: I'm just confused as to why it wouldn't be a point after being captured
wurfmaul3: Are you here?
DualHelix: I am
wurfmaul3: Ok
wurfmaul3: Whether you capture at d2 or not, you get two points for d3: one point of territory, and one point for a prisoner
DualHelix: Ohh
wurfmaul3: but d2 is only counted as a point when you don't play there (with Japanese rules)
DualHelix: So you just leave the prisoners that are left over and you can get two extra points for each?
wurfmaul3: hmm yes
DualHelix: Ohhh, well that makes sense
DualHelix: Sorry, I know it can be frustrating dealing with a newbie haha
wurfmaul3: it's not frustrating as long as you don't suddenly leave
wurfmaul3: hmm... I think this is enough for now?
wurfmaul3: Your connection seems unstable?
DualHelix: Is it saying that I'm leaving?
wurfmaul3: OGS displays you as leaving the board and coming back again
wurfmaul3: leaving the server indeed
DualHelix: I'm on my phone at the moment, I'm not on my PC.  So when my phone locks I guess it says I leave and then brings me back
wurfmaul3: could be
DualHelix: Sorry about that, I can easily get on my pc
wurfmaul3: I don't really want to say much more about this game, anyway
DualHelix: Haha, why not?
wurfmaul3: easy win for black. From move 11: G4 H5 F2 F6 E3 F7 E6 
wurfmaul3: don't know, I feel it wouldn't be efficient to say much mre
wurfmaul3: more*
wurfmaul3: but if you've got a question you can ask
DualHelix: I appreciate the help
DualHelix: Would you like to play again?  How often do you get online and play?
wurfmaul3: too often
wurfmaul3: we can play again some time
DualHelix: Oh awesome, so I'll see ya around.  How can I add ya as a friend?
DualHelix: Thanks for the game.
wurfmaul3: you can click on my name and then ..
wurfmaul3: Thank you too
DualHelix: Oh I see how it works
wurfmaul3: Ok, see you then
DualHelix: Alright man, I'll catch you another time.  Next time I'll use the PC so I won't leave over and over
