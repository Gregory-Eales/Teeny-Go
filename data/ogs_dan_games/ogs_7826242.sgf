C[Kaworu Nagisa: yeah
Kaworu Nagisa: its often better to make sure your own groups are safe before you put high pressure on your opponent
roy7: I'm thinking if  I go j1 and force your j1 if I can rob some eye space
roy7: but connecting up like h5 makes the side too big
roy7: no way I'm killing any of this right?
roy7: i go j2 i meant
Kaworu Nagisa: if you cant see a way to guarnatee the kill, dont try to kill
Kaworu Nagisa: if you go j2, i got J4

C[Kaworu Nagisa: i checked all of this before i played G2
Kaworu Nagisa: I guaranteed that G2 worked before i played it, is what im saying
