C[szabo.krisztian24: thanks, I will
szabo.krisztian24: so I will solidify my influence on the right by g5
mark5000: A good idea

(;B[ge]
C[mark5000: I should extend my influence too.

(;W[dg]
C[szabo.krisztian24: a knights move, I see
mark5000: A regular jump (C2) is ok too
mark5000: I mean C3
szabo.krisztian24: I kind of want to defend with e3, but I also could extend to e7
mark5000: C2 would be too distant
szabo.krisztian24: i see
szabo.krisztian24: I think I'll claim the upper right

(;B[ec]
C[mark5000: Both moves are decent ideas. You can also think about aggressive moves like C6 or D7
szabo.krisztian24: oh yes, d7 would have been better

(;W[fg]
C[mark5000: I'll claim some more territory here
szabo.krisztian24: yes, so what are my options here
szabo.krisztian24: maybe c6?
mark5000: A few
szabo.krisztian24: to push you down
mark5000: C6 is a very good move
mark5000: You can also think about G3 and C7
szabo.krisztian24: because I have the support now
mark5000: Right
szabo.krisztian24: I think I need to be aggressive now, as I'm short on territory

C[mark5000: I want to keep my side area
szabo.krisztian24: should I escape via d6 or extend to c7? I think I can't hane at b7
]
(;B[cc]
C[mark5000: C7 is a good shape. You can also think about cross cutting with B5
mark5000: C7 is better that D6
szabo.krisztian24: yes, because then I would also lose my upper left

C[szabo.krisztian24: now I top you off at b8

C[mark5000: There are overtime periods. Don't worry

C[szabo.krisztian24: what are my options, maybe a8?
mark5000: Yes
mf10t: d1. From move 20:

C[mark5000: This is the end game part. That means all that is left is to seal the borders.
szabo.krisztian24: yup

(;W[be]
C[mark5000: I could not block at A7
mark5000: You would play B5 and kill three stones
szabo.krisztian24: yes
szabo.krisztian24: so I can push you back a bit with a7

C[szabo.krisztian24: thanks for the game
mark5000: 5 points. Not bad!!
mark5000: I think you have the right idea
szabo.krisztian24: thanks, I'm practicing with the 17 kyu bot
szabo.krisztian24: but it's too damn good
szabo.krisztian24: so it's nice to actually play with a real person
mark5000: Want a quick review?
szabo.krisztian24: Just wanted to ask
