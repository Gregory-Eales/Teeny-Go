C[ATTACK ON STONE: How did you mastered at 9x9 board?
ATTACK ON STONE: Sorry for my English

C[mark5000: Lots of practice. Life and death practice is so important. For example, you don't know that the upper left is a dead shape. It is. I also looked at all pro 9x9 games I could find to see how they play.

C[ATTACK ON STONE: I lose the stone upper left and you have 5.5 Koji , I think I have no chance to win
mark5000: Seems correct
mark5000: Thanks for the game
mark5000: Besides life and death, check your opening too.
ATTACK ON STONE: No , thanks to you 
ATTACK ON STONE: You were nice with me
ATTACK ON STONE: Ty
mark5000: Move 3 was not so good. It is a diagonal jump away from your first stone. It's a weird relationship.
mark5000: Try one of these three places. From move 2: 
mark5000: e3 or f3 or g5
mark5000: One-space jumps or knight's moves. No diagonal jump.
mark5000: Diagonal jump is a weak movement.
ATTACK ON STONE: Thanks a lot 
mark5000: You're welcome! See you later.
ATTACK ON STONE: I will note all this.
ATTACK ON STONE: Yup
ATTACK ON STONE: See you
