C[ovijol: I think g4 (instead of b5) is stronger, and tactically more interesting. But i am not so brave so you correctly guessed i will play b5.

C[mark5000: Good find. G4 is better than the move I expected.
mark5000: Maybe E5 was a mistake.

C[ovijol: I was about to play D8 in order to avoid your D7. It might be (maybe) winning for black by a little. If you do not mind we could analize this line at the end of the game... 
ovijol: In the meantime I found A7

C[mark5000: Honestly, both D8 and B6 win. My mistake was move 6 E5, which should be C5.
mark5000: B+1.5. From move 26: D8 D9 D7 B6 B8 A8 B9 A4 C6 A5 C5 H2 H5 J3 J4 J2 C9 A3 E9 A6 A9 A7 
mark5000: B also has this option. Even living C8 group may not be enough.. From move 26: D8 D9 D7 A8 B6 B9 H2 H1 B2 
mark5000: I saw this B+0.5 earlier, but it was too simple and losing. From move 13: G4 G5 H5 H6 H4 F5 F4 J6 A4 C6 A5 A6 A3 J5 J4 
mark5000: Another B+0.5. From move 13: G4 G5 H5 H6 F5 G6 H4 A3 A2 A4 J6 J7 J5 H7 B2

C[mark5000: This?. From move 47: H1 A8 A6 A8 
mark5000: I could be missing something obvious, but I thought better to have a small thing in ko (with threats) than the whole thing in limbo.

C[ovijol: In fact, I am a chess player, so I have never played a 19x19 game  ;-)   (only some 13x13 ones)
]
(;W[dh]
C[mark5000: Oh really? That IS interesting.
mark5000: 13x13 is like mini 19x19. The strategies are pretty similar.
mark5000: 9x9 really is a whole nother animal
ovijol: I like strategies and I guess I can play at about 10k... You could give me 9 stones and win easily.
ovijol: There are two reasons for not playing 19x19. The most important is the games are toooooo long and I am getting too old. The second thing is I do not want to learn joseki (It is indeed necessary to reach a certain level).
ovijol: Well, I am happy with the small board.
mark5000: I ran out of threats so I think I lose.

C[ovijol: Fork at move 55. From move 55: F1 D8 G6 H7 E8 G1 F3 D8 H8 H6 E8 E1 D1 D8 H5 J5 E8 
ovijol: By the way, I wonder if F1 instead of F3 was better because I would have had less threads... Maybe I am wrong again.

ovijol: It seems that A6 was also loosing for B. An interesting seki
ovijol: So maybe D8 at 26 was winning...
ovijol: I am trying to analize it but it is quite complex...
ovijol: In the meantime, the game has finished. Thank you very much, I learned (and thought) a lot!!

C[mark5000: Thanks. I have some regrets about this game. I looked at my move 6 with AI and think I will avoid this move in the future. It wasn't the losing move though; you outplayed me in the ko and kept the pressure on beforehand so that I didn't have much success in the tight invasion space.
mark5000: I also think you had some clear wins that you missed. I shared variations in notes during the game
ovijol: Well, if B6 was losing for B (with F1 for white afterwards) then D8 was the only winning chance for B. I was analising it and found similar lines to you. I played B6 because it seemed "easier" for me.
ovijol: I like your B7 defensive move a lot..
ovijol: Regarding E5, I have seen C5 previously as the "standard" move in this line
ovijol: Thanks again, I hope we meet soon again
