Ryo112358: ah ok
Ryo112358: thanks for the games!
mark5000: You would win the game!
mark5000: Thanks.
Ryo112358: i guess thts why ur 2 dan :)
mark5000: I'm trying to do 3 dan but it's not easy
Ryo112358: have you studied shusaku's records?
mark5000: I know he's really popular, but I've never studied his games. Maybe I should!
Ryo112358: There's a book called Invincible with his games
Ryo112358: I've heard that he never lost as black
Ryo112358: but it has his games playing both colors
Ryo112358: I looked at one of them
mark5000: That is mostly true, yeah
mark5000: There was no komi, so if he could do even against other players he would win often.
Ryo112358: the ear-reddening game
Ryo112358: how long did it take you to get 1dan?
mark5000: about 2 months from 1 dan, but from beginner to 2 dan was maybe 5 years.
Ryo112358: oh ok
mark5000: Actually, it was more than 2 months. I don't remember
Ryo112358: i'm aiming for 1 dan by the summer
Ryo112358: don't even know if thts possible but i'm going for it
Ryo112358: playing you will def help
mark5000: Cool
mark5000: I just checked, it was six months from 1 to 2 dan
mark5000: I was way off
Ryo112358: that sounds pretty fast though
mark5000: I guess so. I was studying a lot.
Ryo112358: i played another 2 dan today, and i'm pretty sure you game is better
Ryo112358: *you're
Ryo112358: not tht he wasn't good
Ryo112358: anyway i'm gonna play another game, i'll see you later!
