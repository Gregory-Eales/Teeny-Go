C[mark5000: thanks
mark5000: you did really well
DeathTheKid101: thanks
DeathTheKid101: i dont think so 
mark5000: I only won by 3 points
mark5000: That means you would be 4k or something
mark5000: Or I'm really bad :-)
DeathTheKid101: okay... but i felt i was getting push aroumd..
mark5000: Maybe it's because you started at 3-3
mark5000: It's a bit submissive in 9x9
DeathTheKid101: how do i counter it?
mark5000: Professional players play all other moves on or above the third line, actually
DeathTheKid101: like 5-3 and so on?
mark5000: yes
mark5000: I couldn't find many real mistakes after move 1
DeathTheKid101: can we play again then?
mark5000: Maybe it's just a hard start
mark5000: Maybe after lunch.
DeathTheKid101: and thanks. maybe so. in middle game i tend to do better 
mark5000: yeah
mark5000: in 9x9 the opening lasts 4-5 moves and that's it
mark5000: in this game it was maybe 3 moves
DeathTheKid101: and okay. and so what do i need to do to improve the start?
DeathTheKid101: and okay
mark5000: I'm not certain it's meaningful to say. After f6 and g3 and f4, black is already controlling the center and white is defending, so I would just avoid that pattern
DeathTheKid101: okay, thanksc
DeathTheKid101: thanks*
mark5000: I may be back in an hour
mark5000: I'll ttyl
