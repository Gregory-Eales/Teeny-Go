C[DavidGïrth: so do i always start on hoshi?
DavidGïrth: is that what its called
DavidGïrth: haha
mark5000: No.
DavidGïrth: oops
mark5000: Hoshi means star point in Japanese
DavidGïrth: yep
mark5000: Hoshi on this board could be 3-3 or 5-5.
DavidGïrth: yeah
mark5000: You can also choose any point between them
mark5000: any of these is good. From move 0: 
DavidGïrth: okayy
mark5000: Yeah, that's fine

C[DavidGïrth: i have a question
DavidGïrth: how would i approach someone placing a piece right next to mine
]
(;B[cc]
C[mark5000: The basic instinct is to bend around it.
DavidGïrth: how would i play the cross-cut?
mark5000: Sometimes that doesn't work, then you can just extend from it
mark5000: Extending from the weaker stone is normal
DavidGïrth: i see
mark5000: It depends on the context of the situation though
mark5000: Sometimes you want to atari, but in general it's extend the weak side.
DavidGïrth: okay
mark5000: You have to have a specific tactical reason not to play it.

(;W[ge]
C[DavidGïrth: mmm
DavidGïrth: also
DavidGïrth: why do people
DavidGïrth: place the stone around
DavidGïrth: 2 stones away
DavidGïrth: when they attack
DavidGïrth: but not right next to it

(;B[hd]
C[mark5000: Both can be good
mark5000: The purpose is different
mark5000: Contact tends to induce a response, so your opponent gets strong in the area
DavidGïrth: ohh
mark5000: Playing farther away means they probably won't play nearby, so it's actually weaker.
DavidGïrth: so its better to play further away
DavidGïrth: ?
mark5000: On 9x9 I would say it's equal. On larger boards it's better to give some space.
DavidGïrth: i see
DavidGïrth: thanks! :D
mark5000: Because on larger boards the goal in the opening is to "sketch" out a kind of framework (where you want your points to come from)
DavidGïrth: is there any particular way
DavidGïrth: you should sketch out that framework?
mark5000: 9x9 is different. There is no area to map out. It's just a knife fight
DavidGïrth: ohhhhh i see
mark5000: Just look at any dan player's 19x19 game opening and you will see what it's like

C[DavidGïrth: how do you mean?
mark5000: I mean, when the game ends what part of the board will be yours?

C[DavidGïrth: not sure HAHA
DavidGïrth: should i decide now
DavidGïrth: or
mark5000: You should decide from move 1, actually
DavidGïrth: woops
DavidGïrth: hahahhaha

C[mark5000: I'll show you later
DavidGïrth: ok sweet
DavidGïrth: how would you recommend i improve?
DavidGïrth: i found it easy to improve from day1 to day2
mark5000: I'm going to be critical here. Take this move out of your head. Don't hit your opponent on the nose like this.
DavidGïrth: oh
DavidGïrth: okay 
DavidGïrth: is it because
mark5000: It's  just a bad shape.

mark5000: You played how many days?
DavidGïrth: 2 days
mark5000: It's awesome.
DavidGïrth: should i read more strategies? or just play more
DavidGïrth: thanks! :
DavidGïrth: :)
mark5000: Most 2-day players can't make one living group
mark5000: You made two, sort of
DavidGïrth: hahahaha
