C[xhu98: Thanks :)))))))))))))))))))))))
xhu98: I read that it would be 0.5 win
gamesorry: Before H9 I was debating whether I should risk for the seki or 0.5 loss
xhu98: Right
xhu98: The game, match and title-deciding atari
gamesorry: But since you played h9, it's obvious you know there's something in the corner :)
xhu98: Thank God I did
xhu98: I thought there was going to be some aji too
xhu98: I literally jumped up when I saw that
gamesorry: Yup :) Actually I was sad when I found there're seki ajis in both of my groups :(
xhu98: Yeah, very unfortunate :(
xhu98: Well, commiserations
xhu98: Was a pity that there had to be a losre
xhu98: *loser
gamesorry: Still, congratulations, new Mingren xhu! 
xhu98: Thanks :)
gamesorry: (This is my 4th defeat in the title matches)
xhu98: Now I hope I get to concentrate as well
xhu98: in other tournaments
xhu98: Because this was my maiden final
xhu98: I spent so much time staring at the games
gamesorry: Yup, maybe we should ask matburt/anoek to transfer the titles in the profile page ?
xhu98: Maybe you can since you are the title admin now :)
xhu98: Oh, you haven't got a title yet?
gamesorry: Sure, I planned to do so, anyway the mods (you and mark) are holding 3 titles totally XD
gamesorry: Yep, I've never won any title unfortunately :( But then again, it keeps me fighting haha
xhu98: Keep fighting \\o/
xhu98: This tournament had some pretty strong contenders
gamesorry: Yes, the competitions are intense and fantastic :)
gamesorry: That's why I like the Title tournaments a lot:)
xhu98: Well, this is still 2014 for some reason
gamesorry: Right, Mingren 2014 was not held by the system somehow
gamesorry: And I decided not to skip a year ;-) But hopefully Mingren NInes 2016 would start by the end of 2016:)
xhu98: Alright
