C[mark5000: Hi! May this be a good tournament series.
Valkyria9: I have a lot of other games running so it might be slower as usual. Also I will play with old Valkyria. My new program has too many bugs still.

C[Valkyria9: Another well played game! Thx!
mark5000: Thanks
mark5000: c7 may be suspect. After that I could make white rectangle six which canâ€™t live.
mark5000: At least in combination with b5
Deep Scholar: interesting with 4 c7 typically c6 or c5 are more often in the position
