C[mark5000: Wow. That's some move.
Valkyria9: Yes it thinks C7 and B7 is about equal. But B7 was searched most deeply.
mark5000: Valkyria is very good at finding these kinds of second-line moves. This is a blind spot for CrazyStone and some other bots.

C[Valkyria9: I guess most other bots have patterns derived from 19x19 games or is at least tuned for 19x19. Valkyria was mostly developed for 9x9

C[Valkyria9: Somehoe Valkyria had a hole in the search tree, it did not expect H1. Even so it of course evaluated th position as a clear loss but now it does not want to play further. Well played! I will probably remove B7 from the book...
mark5000: gg
mark5000: b5 is probably the move, yeah. It was mostly a one-way street until e2, which was too much
