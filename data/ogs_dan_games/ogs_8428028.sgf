C[ovijol: Despite the huge gap in playing strenght I could not help challenging you... you are one of my heroes in the server!!!
ovijol: I have seen all your videos with xhu98. Your proffesional database is one of my favourites as well.
ovijol: I will try to do my best!
ovijol: I will try tengen. If I have to lose better to do in style.
ovijol: What is your gravatar about? It sounds to Goya to me. A bit scary...
mark5000: Hey, have fun!
mark5000: And yes! My avatar is a Goya painting, or part of one.

C[ovijol: Well, the game is over some moves ago. If you do not mind, I would like to finish it to get the final count.
ovijol: I liked very much your opening... I prefer f7 rather than g6 ( do not ask me exactly why, I find it more flexible) 
ovijol: Then, g7 is very interesting... I though for ages after g6, h6
ovijol: Opening choices. From move 8: 
ovijol: I guess a dan player should play h7, variant A but I was afraid of your tactical strengh. I also knew you played this against popop and It did not go well...
ovijol: After this, I also liked very much the double hane at f8
ovijol: I was thinking again a lot about taking the two stones
ovijol: Taking two stones. From move 12: H7 G8 H8 
ovijol: I did not see it very clear either. This was very "soft".
ovijol: After your h8, only on move 14, the game was over...
ovijol: Could you please give me some improvement over my play? The good thing about being crushed is one learns a lot!!  ;-)

C[mark5000: Yes, absolutely.
mark5000: I have no comment about F7 vs. G6. I play both and consider them equally good choices.
mark5000: This way looks promising. From move 8: G8 G5 H7 G3 C6 
ovijol: Thank you for your answer.  Your variant looks promising. It has the good point of having the two white groups one in front of the other so black obtain the upper side... I tried to get my "big" territory on the lower right.
ovijol: Mark variant. From move 8: G8 G5 H7 G3 C6 B6 C7 
ovijol: In any case I think the two white groups are alive.  The final count would be something like 8+9+5,5(komi) = 22.5 (maybe one or two less).
ovijol: For black, about 21-22+ 1 prisoner + 0 (possible nothing in the lower side).
ovijol: Very close indeed!.
ovijol: When I started playing go (I have played chess all my life) I was very surprised to find there are no opening books in go. In chess, opening are 80% of the professional training.
ovijol: I have played only 9x9 (I have little time) and now I have started playing 13x13 and I have understood why. In any case there have been an impressive work on joseki.
ovijol: I think it is perfectly possible for 9x9 to have opening books like in chess. The problem is many people consider 9x9 like a "minor game" compared to the bigger boards.
ovijol: Openings is what I like more in 9x9. If I had the time (but I have little) I would like to create a "Enciclopedia of 9x9 go openings".
ovijol: Well, I am loosing my mind... ha, ha, ha

C[mark5000: We think alike. I created an opening book as a puzzle on this website.
ovijol: I know it. But it contain only professional games. Maybe I am wrong but I think dan players at this site play games as good as theirs... I am painfully creating a database with games from ogs. I have got about 1000 games already. It would be so nice to have something similar to that in waltheri web page. But there they use games from goquest that are fast games with lower quality

C[ovijol: Well, I guess loosing against a dan player by 1.5 is not that bad... but I am a bit dissapointed because the game was decided so early (by move 15 it was already done)
ovijol: Then, you played like alphago, trying to play safe despite the score. I do not know if I could have improved the score somehow...
ovijol: I L
ovijol: I liked the opening. I have to study it in depth. Your double hane was fun, as well, but very difficult to handle.
ovijol: Thank you very much for the game. Maybe when I have improved (reached 7-8k ) will challenge again to test my progress ;-)
