C[battleporridge: thanks
battleporridge: gg
JustBreathing: ty
battleporridge: you mean like this?. From move 20: D3 
battleporridge: that would have been good too
battleporridge: it's just a decision of which side i wanna take, not sure which one is better
battleporridge: was it though? W got too much on the left
battleporridge: maybe this was better. From move 22: E3 
battleporridge: actually probably not, W still gets the left. From move 22: E3 F2 G2 D3 H5 
battleporridge: yeah
battleporridge: really i lost because i didn't get to capture f8
battleporridge: if i could finish the bottom in sente, i could have gone back and capture that
battleporridge: yeah, this is sente for W. From move 32: 
battleporridge: if i capture now, i dont see a way to live. From move 32: G8 H3 
froofy: Yes.
froofy: I'm not so good, so I have to guess, so I was just wondering what you were thinking at the time, why you made the decision you made.
froofy: I guess white can still get quite a bit on the sides that way.
froofy: Your way was very good.
froofy: Yeah, it's tough.
froofy: Seems like white can get a corner somehow.
froofy: Always.
froofy: You are dead otherwise, though, correct?
