C[mark5000: H5 was a bit weird and maybe passive.
mark5000: An aggressive tactic may be better. From move 4: D3 E3 D2 D4 C4 E4 C5

C[mark5000: It's hard to ignore an attachment, but this counterattack looks nice. From move 22: D3 D2 E3 E2 F3 F2 G3 
mark5000: If that's working, maybe I screwed up.
mark5000: Maybe here for me.. From move 5: D7
