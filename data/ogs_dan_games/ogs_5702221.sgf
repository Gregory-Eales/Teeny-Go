C[mark5000: Ok, if that works, then you should update senseis library.
mark5000: http://senseis.xmp.net/?RectangularEightInTheCorner
mark5000: I checked it before playing elsewhere to be sure, but now you play J8 and it seems working.
mark5000: Well, vgg.
mark5000: It's hard to identify mistakes this game. Maybe G5 is not possible.
mark5000: If you are running a program I'm interested in the output
gamesorry: Oh I've met Rectangular Eight in a few games
gamesorry: Every time I played 1-2 for seki, but it seems sensei's library has a better move that could create a ko :)
gamesorry: When I have time, I'll add the alternative moves to that page :-)
gamesorry: (I didn't use a program btw)
gamesorry: Maybe instead of G7, replying at B6 could be better?
