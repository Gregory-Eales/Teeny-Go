C[Aloisius: shit. sadaharu passes away
Aloisius: My opinion: the main problem of Go is, that nobody and especially no Go player (beside me) understands the value
Aloisius: This is the compatibility to the real world. Everything you use in Go strategy is nearby 1:1 useful in the real world
Aloisius: For example "Ownership owns". To learn this in the real world means many real losses. Learn it in Go - its only a mandala away.
mark5000: "sadaharu passes away" Where did you hear this? It's a big loss to the Go community if true. We would miss him dearly.
