C[Alxco: thank you for the game
speedothebrief: well, that started going wrong on move 3
speedothebrief: lol
speedothebrief: thanks
speedothebrief: i'm curious about your center play
speedothebrief: did you ever intend to connect to it?
Alxco: yes, F6 after E5 was bad, leaving the aji of the 3-3, you should avoid that
Alxco: no i didn't
speedothebrief: hmm, 
speedothebrief: yeah, i was already playing from weakness
speedothebrief: on move 4
Alxco: the groups were strong enough to live so my plan was to let you attack one of them while taking the rest of the territory elsewhere
speedothebrief: yeah, that's an interesting strategy for black
speedothebrief: normally, I would think that way as white, knowing that a split board is victory
speedothebrief: thanks for the review
Alxco: on a 9x9 board, the second move is already a starting attack so you have to play strong
speedothebrief: yeah, no kidding
Alxco: and think early of a strategy
speedothebrief: yeah, it almost isn't the same game as 19x19
Alxco: 1. From move 5: D7 F5 G3 
speedothebrief: So, on move 4, I should have played G6
speedothebrief: ?
Alxco: it depend, both are good
speedothebrief: right, so, I keep the F7 group alive, and begin on the lower right, keeping sente
Alxco: but i would rather let black connect and take territory elsewhere like in the variation
Alxco: yes
speedothebrief: yeah, that is clearly better
Alxco: black will likely play something else, not connecting to keep sente but this is another game
speedothebrief: yes, I see my error in this game was playing from weakness on my 2nd move, 
speedothebrief: because of your rank
speedothebrief: thank you again for the review, and good luck in the tournament!
Alxco: thank you, you too ! Anyway the most classic response to tengen in a 9x9 board is G5
Alxco: black can start pressuring white or play strong with C5 letting white pick a side and choose were the fight will start
Alxco: good luck with the other players of the tournament. See you
