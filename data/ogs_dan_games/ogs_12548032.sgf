C[insertwit: thanks for the game
insertwit: yea, when black played H7, i think black secured victory, tho i think it was reckless of black to play H7 so late  and not sooner. Black had no real ko threats well before H7, and i think if black didn't play H7 it'd be a ko that was hard for black to win
