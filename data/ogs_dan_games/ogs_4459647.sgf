C[Strawfish: is e5 good here?
mark5000: Yes

C[Strawfish: now
Strawfish: i always question between, f6, e4, and e3
Strawfish: usually i do e3
mark5000: e4 looks ugly
Strawfish: sometimes i might think of f3
mark5000: e3 is a bit better but it's still lacking
Strawfish: which is a more solid move?
mark5000: white would move up and get pretty much all the right side area
mark5000: f6 is the best move here
Strawfish: ok
]
(;B[fd]
C[Strawfish: but then white gets the bottom side?
mark5000: white has a lot of points now. From move 4: E3 F7 
Strawfish: ah ok
]
(;W[gd]
C[Strawfish: now i think about g7,h7
mark5000: don't do h7
Strawfish: or g5
mark5000: It's disconnected
Strawfish: is that stone dead if i does?
mark5000: I look at g7 f7 or e3
Strawfish: when do i make greedy 1 gap jumps then?
mark5000: Probably, yeah. h7 would be dying very soon
Strawfish: and are moves connected like d5 to f6
mark5000: 1 space jumps are good if they are connected
Strawfish: assuming nothing else is played
Strawfish: too big of a jump
mark5000: If I didn't have g6 then your h7 would be a good move
Strawfish: ah ok
mark5000: when I have g6 it's too easy for me to move up and separate them
Strawfish: so its fine if there is nothing there seperating
mark5000: exactly
mark5000: one group > two groups
Strawfish: what about if there is are two stones next to each other
Strawfish: white and black
Strawfish: and black sandwiches 
mark5000: usually bad, but it depends

C[Strawfish: ok

C[Strawfish: now i look at e7
mark5000: WHy not save the stone?
Strawfish: oh yea
Strawfish: didnt see that

C[mark5000: You don't want me to capture you

(;W[hc]
(;B[gb]
C[Strawfish: yea I didn't see it
mark5000: Now I see I have cuts
mark5000: I don't like you doing h6 or g5

(;W[he]
C[mark5000: So I'll defend
Strawfish: ah ok
Strawfish: it's good to leave pieces as "prisoners" if they are destined to die?
mark5000: Yeah
mark5000: F7 isn't totally dead though
mark5000: I could F8 and maybe cause trouble
]
(;B[ec]
C[mark5000: I couldn't do it now though
Strawfish: isn't f7 dead now?
Strawfish: no way it lives right?
mark5000: It's totally dead
mark5000: F8 would be a bad move for both players
Strawfish: yea

C[mark5000: Now it's a good move though

C[Strawfish: what about c2?
mark5000: I could still atari
Strawfish: oh yea
Strawfish: c3?
mark5000: Try c3 - solid
Strawfish: i was thinking that
]
(;B[cg]
C[mark5000: That move is like the h7 move you wanted earlier
mark5000: I have D2 and E3 so it's easy to cut your stone off
mark5000: Yeah, that's what you do
mark5000: That's the thought process
mark5000: First, think of the move you want to play
mark5000: Then think if it's safe or not
Strawfish: mm
Strawfish: I knew c3 was a good move
mark5000: If yes play it. If no, try something safer
Strawfish: but then i looked and thought b2 was good
mark5000: Then repeat
Strawfish: but didnt think far enough ahead

C[mark5000: Now it works

C[Strawfish: whoops

(;W[bi]
C[mark5000: See this
mark5000: Try to notice when you're connected and when you're not
Strawfish: i misclicked
mark5000: I'll undo
mark5000: The stone is still cut off though
mark5000: At least you saved a stone
mark5000: NOw I think black can't win this game
Strawfish: yea
Strawfish: ok thanks

Strawfish: how does overtime work?
mark5000: You chose: Japanese Byo-Yomi: Clock starts with 10 minutes main time, followed by 5 30 seconds periods.
mark5000: you get 5 periods of 30 seconds overtime
Strawfish: why 5 periods?
Strawfish: why not just 2 minutes 30 secs
mark5000: You can have just one period like that
mark5000: maybe 1 period of 30 sec is fine too
Strawfish: so a period is consumed once a move?
Strawfish: you don't get it back?
mark5000: nonono
mark5000: You get the 30 sec back after the move
mark5000: If you go OVER 30 sec, then you lose a period
Strawfish: ah interesting
Strawfish: so each move can go on for 29 seconds
mark5000: It's like 30 sec a move with 5 grace, I guess
Strawfish: and you keep all 5?
mark5000: yeah
Strawfish: that's interesting
mark5000: You can choose 1 period 5 sec for blitz games
mark5000: or 10 periods 10 sec
mark5000: it's what you want
Strawfish: ah ok
Strawfish: thanks
Strawfish: I'm going to get some lunch now
Strawfish: thanks for the help!
mark5000: see you
