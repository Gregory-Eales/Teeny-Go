C[nomadfarmer: a forlorn hope :o)
nomadfarmer: Thought I'd sneak in a teaching game since I'm closing in on you on the ladder
nomadfarmer: have fun
mark5000: Haha, yeah. Let's enjoy it!!

C[nomadfarmer: do you play on that blitz phone app much?
nomadfarmer: goquest
nomadfarmer: had to look at my phone to remember what it's called
mark5000: I don't, actually. It's a pretty tall order to have my correspondence games here just by itself.
nomadfarmer: -nod- But goquest games take 2 minutes!
nomadfarmer: I actually have been thinking that more live games will help me get improving again more than playing correspondence games as much as I do

C[nomadfarmer: oh, that's not an invasion I would have thought of.
mark5000: It's a bit low but at least there's miai for life. It was this or G6 and I couldn't decide between them so I picked the more interesting one.
nomadfarmer: yeah, I was looking at g6 and the 3-3s... 
nomadfarmer: I was trying to understand how C7 peeps cutting B

C[nomadfarmer: very curious how you'd respond to E8, but this was my first instinct and I came back to it after trying to imagine other options

(;W[fb]
C[mark5000: I think I'd try a low approach c8 or g8
nomadfarmer: I didn't spend long looking at those actually
nomadfarmer: I thought of them as candidates but spent more time trying to read what might happen from attaching
nomadfarmer: mostly, I decided that attaching felt crazy complicated.
mark5000: It would be, yeah.
nomadfarmer: for whatever silly reason I mostly read W d8 more than f8... of course, like every game with a stronger player there's the immediate "of course that was the best response, why didn't I spend my time reading that one?"
mark5000: haha, yeah

C[nomadfarmer: oh, was your missing hammer actually an april fool's joke? Just realized that you have it back
mark5000: Yes it was.
nomadfarmer: I had noticed it and just assumed you were taking a break for some reason
nomadfarmer: this is a super interesting game... glad I went for it
mark5000: I had no choice :))
nomadfarmer: I know... I was aiming at thank you but realized that I had initiated and it sounded funny

C[nomadfarmer: Also... I'm really interested to hear your thoughts on B2. I kind of figured that I can't overcome komi no matter what I do, but I thought B2 was most likely to be sente of the 3 areas I could find to play. Would H4 have been better?
nomadfarmer: H4 instead of H3 to try to keep sente

C[nomadfarmer: another question... I can't find a way to damage W around C2 more than W at H8... so this response seems necessary

C[mark5000: C3 is sente so it's possible to have both moves. I don't think it's enough though.
nomadfarmer: -nod- All of my thinking and counting led to I couldn't ever overcome komi. I didn't think that C3 ended in sente for me, though... but that was without the A6 exchange which I could have taken myself
mark5000: I thought you were gonna take a ko there for a while.
nomadfarmer: I wondered about it but Id didn't' see a single threat that was worth the life of everything :o)
nomadfarmer: and it's one of those that the initiator has to find the first threat
