C[mark5000: Thanks
Ryo112358: thanks for the game!
Ryo112358: any tips?
mark5000: Your opening was pretty good.
mark5000: E6 was not making any points though
mark5000: block me. From move 12: F8 
mark5000: If you keep the right you could maybe win.
Ryo112358: oh ok
mark5000: You kept good center control, but you let me bend around you quite far.
mark5000: When I took all the top side the game was over.
Ryo112358: yea i think thts my prob, the center control
Ryo112358: i want the whole board
Ryo112358: haha
Ryo112358: i need to pick a side i think
mark5000: You split me up from move 3, which was good
mark5000: You need to decide a plan though. Kill one of them or keep both small.
Ryo112358: it would be hard to kill the left, i had more control on the right
Ryo112358: great advice appreciate it
mark5000: You could lean on the right to attack the left. From move 4: F4 G4 G5 H5 H6 J4 C5 
Ryo112358: ah ok
mark5000: It's a different game though
Ryo112358: yes
mark5000: I think your opening to move 11 was probably good enough
mark5000: move 13 was the losing move because I could take too much solid territory to come back
Ryo112358: see it now
mark5000: You didn't play like 24k here. More like 15k.
Ryo112358: thanks i started last week :)
mark5000: It's good
Ryo112358: i'm inspired though ;)
mark5000: awesome. I'll see you later.
Ryo112358: yep thanks for game and tips!
