C[Valkyria9: When I terminated search the principal variation was 73 ply deep with two kofight along the variation.

C[mark5000: Oh wow
mark5000: Does Valkyria have an opinion about komi? I think it should be 5 (area scoring rules).

C[Valkyria9: In my experience it should be 7.0 which is also used in computer go competitions.

C[Valkyria9: C8 seems to be a move that Valkyria only understands (if it does) after very deep search

C[mark5000: That move must be a declaration of victory. It does seem I'm a point or two behind now.
mark5000: gg
mark5000: If the clamp can't work, then
mark5000: next best alternative. From move 15: E8 D8 G6 
mark5000: Also congrats on 3/5 wins. I'll try to win the other two.
Valkyria9: Thanks! The other two look really good for you, but V. will probably do its best too make it long and complicated. I will take a look at the variation.
Valkyria9: After your variation Valkyria expects H4, H7 and G3. After this white plays H9 or D9 with win rate about 50%
