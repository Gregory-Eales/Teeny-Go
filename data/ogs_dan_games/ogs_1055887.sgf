ST000MA: are there many versions of fuego or just one?
mark5000: In GoGUI, there is a parameters setting that gives a number of seconds forced thinking time a move

ST000MA: yeah this is not me playing... :P
mark5000: ST000MA would have a living group, at the very least.
ST000MA: but if you want, we can play one game and review it later
