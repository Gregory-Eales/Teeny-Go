C[wurfmaul3: :'(
wurfmaul3: Thanks for the game
PapaSmurf: thank you o_o
PapaSmurf: timesuji turns success
PapaSmurf: since this is alive. From move 35: B1 C1 B4 C4 A5 A4 A3 B3 
PapaSmurf: since this is alive 2. From move 35: B1 C1 A4 B4 A5 A3 A7 B2 C4 D4 
wurfmaul3: Yeah, I thought I was dead, then after the timesuji "wait..."
PapaSmurf: yea i think i tricked you there
wurfmaul3: I think j4 instead of e8
wurfmaul3: h7 seems good too?
wurfmaul3: I think it lost points 
wurfmaul3: but yeah I should be proud of it
PapaSmurf: maybe something like this. From move 42: J4 E8 H8 A4 B4 A5 A3 A7 B2 D4 C4 B8 G1 H7 J8 G9 J7 H9 J6 F9 E7 D8 
PapaSmurf: maybe not E4
PapaSmurf: perhaps a bit too passive
wurfmaul3: I doubt e5
wurfmaul3: If you just answer at e1, can I live?
wurfmaul3: without c5 in sente a2 doesn't seem to work
PapaSmurf: I was thinking about D6 instead of C7
PapaSmurf: but that also doesn't look safe
wurfmaul3: looks difficult for both
PapaSmurf: gonna be semeai
PapaSmurf: B c4 then looks rough
wurfmaul3: d1 e1 is going to hurt me in a semeai
wurfmaul3: (actually it's going to hurt me in any position, oh well)
wurfmaul3: I think after your a6 my group really was dead
PapaSmurf: i thought so, but there was too much aji i guess
PapaSmurf: again going back to lame e4 move
wurfmaul3: Do you really mean e4?
PapaSmurf: making 2 groups with w makes it much easier to win than with 1 group
wurfmaul3: isn't black in big trouble here?. From move 27: E1 
PapaSmurf: i read some trouble after D4
PapaSmurf: but with F6 aji maybe there wasn't any
wurfmaul3: It's confusing
PapaSmurf: in that case.... From move 27: E1 D4 E5 C5 F6 G5 G6 H6 G7 H7 G8 A2 B1 C1 B4 C4 H8 J3 H1 J4 G1 J8 A5 A4 A7 B3 H9 
wurfmaul3: white e5 is pretty much sente right?
wurfmaul3: I just seems to me it was too early in the game
PapaSmurf: maybe... 5am =.=
wurfmaul3: 5am too
PapaSmurf: gg, and gnight o/
wurfmaul3: gg and gnight too
wurfmaul3: bye!
Naabi: yeah
Naabi: so H7 instead of E8?
Naabi: oh, white has to back off regardless
Naabi: That was what I immediately thought, but was reading B4 :D
Naabi: D1 was kind of brilliant
Naabi: so in that case white would have lost, hmh
Naabi: so what for white?
Naabi: yeah
Naabi: variation?
