C[mark5000: Thanks. Move 6 was a very good move and I felt I had lost at that point in the game.
earlgreyhot: Thank you too
earlgreyhot: I think you could have captured that white stone at G3 with G4 as Move 7. That could have resulted black taking right side while white taking left side, black being in slight favor.
