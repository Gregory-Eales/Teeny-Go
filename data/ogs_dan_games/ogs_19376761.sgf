C[mark5000: Net was the only answer that made any sense to me.
mark5000: E4 might have been more tactically interesting earlier.
mark5000: like here. From move 13: E4 
deepwell: I suppose you are referring to F3 as the net, and if so i agree totally. I did consider playing E3 earlier but i didnt :)
deepwell: thank you for the game, until next time.
mark5000: Thanks.
