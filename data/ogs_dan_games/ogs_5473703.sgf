C[Smeg: thanks for the game
wurfmaul3: Thanks
Smeg: Any ideas for better response?
wurfmaul3: I think you were winning here. From move 22: D5 D6 F4 F6 
Smeg: Yeah it was kind of greedy of me to try to threat with cut of the left group
Smeg: Really enjoyed the game anyway, thx :)
wurfmaul3: Hm yeah. It was enough to threaten it while capturing two stones.
wurfmaul3: e7 was small, maybe you still had a chance
Smeg: I see now it was unnecessary
wurfmaul3: Thanks again, good luck
