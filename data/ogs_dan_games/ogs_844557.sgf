C[Franzisa: To be honest, I would love to be better at 19x19 and less good at 9x9 :D
Franzisa: It's a curse sometimes
Franzisa: When I claim I can play like a 2k on the 9x9 board and then lose to a 13k on the 19x19
Franzisa: Time of facepalm :D

C[Franzisa: Thanks for the game :D
mark5000: Thanks for the game
Franzisa: Well played. :) I had not the slightest chance
mark5000: Your opening was really good though
Franzisa: I copy my openings from Pro games
Franzisa: I was amazed when I found out there are "kinda" Joseki for 9x9
mark5000: Yeah, it's a good way to go.
mark5000: I think maybe B4 could be better placed.
Franzisa: Where would you have put it?
mark5000: I want to attack the lone stone
mark5000: Attaching on either side, I think
mark5000: F3 also seems good.
mark5000: Maybe the bump too. It's hard to say which is best
mark5000: bump. From move 10: E7 F8 D8 G6 H8 
mark5000: attach. From move 10: D8 D7 E7 F8 C7 G6 H6 
mark5000: attach2. From move 10: D8 D7 E7 F8 C7 G6 H8 
Franzisa: Cool, thanks
Franzisa: :D
mark5000: Bye
Franzisa: See you! :)
