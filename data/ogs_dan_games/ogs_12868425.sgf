C[lovecall: let see if it is really a right move
Vivian_Vex: I mean, if I didn't play there my entire group would have died
lovecall: my goal is not to killed but to win
Vivian_Vex: I know and you would have won if you killed the top right
lovecall: no
lovecall: i lost by a few points
lovecall: if i kill immediately
lovecall: i just read  white d5.
Vivian_Vex: Oh
lovecall: and white win by a few points if i go for the kill
Vivian_Vex: I mean that was entirely a sacrifice stone anyway. 
Vivian_Vex: I was actually worried that entire time you would play C3
lovecall: yes but i just read that i lost if i kill immediately
lovecall: not that i will

Vivian_Vex: If there was a moment in this game the difference in skill has been apparent.
