C[Valkyria9: Good luck! This might be last tournament for Valkyria. The rewrite Odin will replace her soon when it is strong enough.
mark5000: That's pretty exciting :)

C[mark5000: Thanks.
mark5000: I thought I could win from move 1, because I never considered 3-3 a good opening move. I'll have to study this game to see what happened.
Valkyria9: I let Valkyria play it to have a game where opening book does not play much of a role. At move 3 Valkyria was 45%
Valkyria9: After move 18 at G7 evaluation was slightly better than 50%
Valkyria9: And it would prefer 18 C2 first (but W G7 is then played later in the principal variation)
Valkyria9: The neural network Odin wants to play 18 A4 for a winrate of 62%
Valkyria9: For move 24 NNOdin would play D3 but now Win rate drops slowly from 51 to 47%. So the conclusion is that perhaps they eyeshape for black in the lower left corner was critical.
mark5000: Interesting!
