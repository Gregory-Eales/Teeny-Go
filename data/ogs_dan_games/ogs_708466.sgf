C[mark5000: Have a good game. You can have handicap stones if you like.
His Majesty Lord Speezwax: You too. I'm not sure how handicap scales in 9x9.  I'd take three I suppose, if that isn't an unreasonably large advantage on this size board.
His Majesty Lord Speezwax: Although in our circumstance there may be no such thing as my having an unreasonably large advantage.

C[mark5000: 3 handicap with komi is about 10 ranks difference.
His Majesty Lord Speezwax: Well nine seems like a lot.  I'll take the star points, we'll see how five works out.
