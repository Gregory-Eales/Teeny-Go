twilightsoutcast: Errr, I can't think of anything else at this point
Van Fanel: Ah
Van Fanel: Alright
Van Fanel: There's a really cool move white can do
twilightsoutcast: Really?!
Van Fanel: And this is just the first of many, many interesting things in the game of go
Van Fanel: Would you like to see it?
twilightsoutcast: yeah

C[Van Fanel: Now how many liberties does that group have?
twilightsoutcast: one?
Van Fanel: And captures happe before suicides!
Van Fanel: So...
Van Fanel: Even if white passes, and black filles it in
Van Fanel: Then blacks only liberty is at  E1
Van Fanel: Can you read that out?
twilightsoutcast: oooo but how do see that far ahead?
Van Fanel: Ah, that's something you acquire...
Van Fanel: It's like learning how to do a backflip n a bike.
Van Fanel: First you need to learn how to ride a bike.
Van Fanel: Then you can do small jumps
Van Fanel: And you work your way up.
Van Fanel: Go is also about building up from the fundamentals.
Van Fanel: But it's also a game where you can become a professonal earning500k a year by palying the basic/common moves only.
twilightsoutcast: right, a lot of patience required though, cuz when you can't ever win, you just sort of give up on thinking
Van Fanel: Hm, well...
Van Fanel: There are lots of moves that you can do that will turn the tide of war.
Van Fanel: many of the most famous games had that type of move
Van Fanel: Where one person was losing by a lot, found a really amazing move, and then won by a small amount.
Van Fanel: It helps to know that every single game ever palyed has had moves like that
Van Fanel: It's just up to us to find them.
Van Fanel: One of the more elementary moves, is the snapback. The thing white just did in this game.
