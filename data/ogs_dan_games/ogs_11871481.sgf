C[lovecall: thx
smurph: ty
smurph: close one
lovecall: this is the winning move. From move 22: 
lovecall: it seems risky but it actually the best move
smurph: well, all the other stuff i analyzed lost
smurph: so
lovecall: I did not read it
smurph: might as well play the ko
lovecall: Oh
smurph: always play the ko CarlSmile
smurph: yea i kept losing by 3.5
smurph: this already loses i think. From move 17: E2 D8 
lovecall: how about this
lovecall: a. From move 21: D8 
smurph: also bad. From move 17: E2 F2 D8 D3 
smurph: when i tried D8 i lost by 0.5
smurph: or 1.5 dr
smurph: after E7 i threw F7 as a hail mary actually
smurph: hoped you'd respond because i think if you extend you should be fine
smurph: *respond with g7
smurph: also it gives me the forcing move at d7
smurph: was g7 necessary after all?
lovecall: should be necessary. From move 12: F8 G7 G8 D7 E8 D8 H7 
smurph: w to move?. From move 12: D7 G7 C6 
smurph: i was afraid of getting split like that
lovecall: just atari should be fine
lovecall: it is pretty much two groups for both
lovecall: white usually has advantage in a match like that.
lovecall: a. From move 12: D7 G7 C6 C3 
smurph: sure.. if both survive :)
smurph: no?. From move 12: D7 G7 C6 C3 H5 E8 D8 F8 H8 
lovecall: oh sure
