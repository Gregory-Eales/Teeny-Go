C[jelmer: mmmmmm, nice try. But you killed me! Congrats.
mark5000: Yeah, it was locally dead from move 11, but maybe there's a way to turn it into a capturing race.
mark5000: capturing race. From move 23: H3 H2 G2 F2 J2 G1 H5 
mark5000: not trading 8 for 9 could leave extra aji too. From move 7: C3 
mark5000: probably this spot to threaten my shape at the same time. From move 7: D3 
mark5000: more hopeful situation for White. From move 7: D3 C4 F4 E3 E4 D4 D2
