C[mark5000: Thanks. All roads lead do death it seems.
mark5000: 1. From move 5: 
mark5000: Does Valkyria have an opinion about which move is better in the opening position? Between F4 and H4, I'm not sure.
mark5000: living?. From move 17: G6 F7 G7 E8 B4 B3 C7 C8 
mark5000: I like it. From move 17: G6 F7 B4 B3 C7 G7 B6 
mark5000: possible to fight. From move 17: G6 F7 B4 B3 C7 C8 D8 
mark5000: Is this dangerous?. From move 17: G6 F7 G7 E8 D1 C1 E1 H3 H2 G1 
mark5000: Good point.
mark5000: Thanks. :-))
Valkyria9: Valkyria has no clear view if F4 or H4 is better. This is in the opening library and eval is very uncertain.
Ten: I don't think white can lose this one. From move 17: G6 F7 G7 F8 B4 B3 C7 
HowToPlay?: ?. From move 17: G6 F7 G7 E8 B4 B3 C7 C8 D6 E6 B6 
Ten: Hmm, I thought to just play endgame if black played soft with e8 like that, but the komi is after all too small in this tournament
Ten: That's a pain
Ten: So got to go this way then, huh. From move 17: G6 F7 B4 B3 C7 
Ten: Hmm, wait a second
Ten: Got it. From move 17: G6 F7 G7 E8 D1 C1 E1 E3 F3 C2 F6 E6 F8 E7 F9 E9 G8 
Ten: I dislike taking risks unless completely necessary :)
Ten: That'll be an eye vs. no eye in the corner, black can never win the capturing race
Ten: White may even just connect
Ten: No prob
