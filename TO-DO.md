## To Do
 - [x] create network
 - [x] create an elo anchor baseline model
 - [x] create dataset
 - [x] train network architectures using supervised learning on a subset (sl)
 - [x] select network for optimal architecture using validation accuracy
 - [x] train best policy and value network using sl for lowest validation error
 - [ ] add monte carlo tree search (mcts)
 - [ ] test sl network + mcts combination
 - [ ] train sl network with reinforcement learning (rl) and mcts
 - [ ] test new rl network using elo
 - [ ] train new network architectures using rl only
 - [ ] test new rl networks for optimal architecture using elo
 - [ ] train best rl only network
 - [ ] test rl only netowork using elo
